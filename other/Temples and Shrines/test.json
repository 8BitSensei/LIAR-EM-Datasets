Limited 3rd/4thC AD pottery suggests that it was either abandoned or little used by this time, or perhaps earlier.  The shrine included two concentric square features, the latter including four large post pits and is sided by a drip gully, indicating that the shrine probably had a superstructure. The shrine is very likely late Iron Age in origin. The temenos ditch also included postholes, indicating a palisade. An early post-Conquest date for the construction of the masonry temple suggests the shrine was relatively short-lived.

Features dating to the late Iron Age comprised an enclosed farmstead on the chalk downland to the south of the valley, and a possible shrine a little further to the south on the northern edge of a hilltop plateau. The farmstead is defined by a concentric curvilinear enclosure, only partially revealed, with a 1.5m entrance within the inner enclosure. Not internal features noted. The potential shrine was previously the site where a gold torc was found. Excavation revealed a palisade trench and a large pit with evidence for burning. A large assemblage of LIA pottery was associated, including probable 'ritually deposited vessels' and worked flint. Iron Age and Roman metalwork (including coins) found during fieldwalking in immediate vicinity. Another probable late Iron Age shrine lay to the north by the river (see ID 4090). It is suggested that there was a period of abandonment between the end of the Iron Age farm (?mid 1st C AD) and establishment of a new farm in the later 1st C AD, c 120m to the SE. The new farmstead probably comprised a systems of rectangular enclosures (though excavation was insufficiently extensive to be sure of this), dated by pottery from the late 1st at least the mid 3rd C AD. The landscape appears to have been re-organised in the later 3rd C AD with a new alignment of large co-axial ditches. Parts of a cobbled yard surface were also revealed. It is suggested that this may have been associated with the establishment of a late Roman villa estate nearby (one of a N-S line of villas in west Norfolk). The ditches were further modified in the 4th C AD, and a corn-drying oven of uncertain form would seem to belong to this phase. This was subsequently re-built (into a complex form) and next to it was a large 4-post structure (granary). The agricultural/processing activity appears to have ceased by the mid 4th C AD, though in its last firing it was used to cremate a human skeleton (radiocarbon dated cal AD 225-383). The volume of early Saxon finds and probable burials indicates early Saxon settlement.",

        "Notes": "Site of a major religious complex with ritual activity dating from the late pre-Roman Iron Age into the later 1st and early 2ndC AD. A flint-built circular temple was constructed around the mid-2ndC AD temple which was soon after replaced by a square stone ambulatory-type temple. The latter lasted into the second half of the 4thC AD and was soon after demolished and robbed away with other structural features of the site.  Since publicity surrounding the metal-detector find of Iron Age and Roman coins in 1983, extensive damage to the site has ensued as treasure hunters continued to dig the site. Excavations by Surrey Archaeological Society in 1985-86 and in 1999 have ensured that as much information as possible about the site has so far been gathered.  The earliest evidence of activity (bar some residual sherds of Bronze Age date) appears to have been a shaft/well at least 2m in diameter sited south of the later temples. However the feature was only excavated down to a depth of 1m and that which lies below this level is unknown. The shaft was connected to the area of the later temples by a cobbled trackway and around the feature lay spreads of charcoal, late Iron Age pottery and burnt bone. Further contexts associated with burning and possible votive deposits were recovered across the area dating to the post-Conquest period, particularly associated with ditches closer to the main temple area. These deposits included articulated groups of animal bones and brooches, amongst other items.  It is suggested that the area which became used for the circular shrine building may have been a 'grove' prior to construction; a possible tree throw pit was also located in the centre of the feature, perhaps providing a focus to the enclosure. The date of construction of the circular temple is unclear but is thought to have taken place in the early-mid 2ndC AD. It is unlikely that the circular building stood for more than 50 years and it seemed to have suffered from construction/foundation problems. A lamb with flanged dish burial was one of the more significant finds from this phase of activity. The excavator argues that the circular temple had been carefully dismantled though its remains were still visible into the 3rdC AD when the square temple was in use.  The curved wall of an apsidal building just to the north of the square temple, first observed by O'Connell (1984), indicates at least one other ancillary building constructed as part of the complex.  A dedicatory deposit close to the temple area and consisting of Iron Age coins, priestly regalia and other votive material (c.AD160-170) underlay the construction level of the square temple. This building was of the more common cella and ambulatory type (both square). No floor levels survived, though scattered tesserae suggests that it was paved. The archaeology of this building had suffered dramatically from detector activity. The building is thought to have gone out of use in the later 4thC AD.",

The grounds falls gently to the south, though more sharply to the north and the site may have been visible from a distance to travellers journeying south along the road. At the site, the road seems to have been slightly but deliberately diverted from its normal course to access the temple.  The general plan of the temple conforms to the more standard Romano-Celtic type with a broadly square cella and temenos, the former measuring c.21x20ft. Considerable quantities of pink wall plaster was found on the outside of the cella, whilst a wall surrounding the cella and temenos was constructed of flint and mortar.  Accurate dating of the building was not possible and all the datable finds were recovered from general debris layers or trenches along the walls; no sealed deposits were found. All the Romano-British pottery was found between the eastern wall of the cella and the boundary wall of the temenos, in what must have been the forecourt of the Temple. From the ceramic evidence it is only possible to suggest that the temple was in use up until in the 3rdC AD. The date of temple construction is tentative though pottery dating c.AD100-150 in the construction layers of the adjacent road would suggest that the temple construction was of a similar date. It must be noted, however, that evidence of Iron Age activity was also found at the site. Though the nature of this activity is not fully understood.",

The site lies on a gentle slope with Tilburstow Hill situated just to the east of the site. The site is thought to lie within the political compass of the Regni, though is thought to have been close to areas under the control of Cantiaci and the Atrebates.  Sepulchral urns were reportedly found in the 19thC after gravel extraction alongside the modern road and, originally, Tilburstow Hill road was thought to run along the route of a Roman road. This was, however, disproved by the identification of the road from the geophysical survey, with confirmation of its presence within one of the evaluation trenches. Around 15 years of metal-detecting  revealed several concentrations of material to the south-west of the north-east field. This area was shown by the geophysical to form a large rectangular enclosure set alongside the road (though the north side was not identified). Roman artefacts recovered from the previous surveying includes 558 Roman coins, around 40 brooches, some lion head studs, a silver ring, and a sceptre handle of a type also found at Wanborough temple. Fieldwalking produced small quantities of tegula and imbrex tiles and 3rd/4thC pottery. It was thought that a Roman temple may lie on the site, but investigations provided no evidence of this type of site.  Further evidence of other enclosures and possible domestic activity were also shown by the geophysical survey to exist further south along the road on both sides. Three large pits were revealed on the opposite side of the road to the possible ritual enclosure, and it was thought that one might have been used as a 'ritual shaft'. However, no evidence for structural deposition was found, though the feature may have been a well or a very deep pit. Evidence of ovens or kilns may suggest domestic or industrial activity. Pottery evidence suggests activity ranging from the mid-1stC, probably relating to the construction of the road, through to the end of the 4thC AD.",

        "Notes": "Situated on the northern edge of the South Downs, Chanctonbury Ring occupies a prominent hilltop position with extensive views northwards across the Weald to the North Downs, and southwards over a considerable stretch of coastline.  In 1909, preparations for tree-planting in the middle of the Ring revealed Romano-British artefacts and a large quantity of flints. After topsoil clearance, the foundations of a Romano-Celtic temple and a smaller flint structure were revealed, the former consisting a cella and portico. The secondary flint structure was interpreted by David Rudling as a 'polygonal shrine'.  The main temple occupied a central, and the most-highest point on the Ring. It could have been intervisible, barring natural cover, with other local religious sites at Pulborough, Muntham Court and Lancing Down.  Bronze Age barrows exist to the south-east of the Ring, though the rampart was found to be of two phases, the first possibly dates to the early Iron Age. Iron Age activity at the site is limited though some feature indicate ritual deposition within the enclosed area, including disarticulated human remains, animal bone, daub, pottery, and imported stone. It has been argued that the hillfort defences may have functioned as a temenos in the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Activity was continuous but intensified most clearly in the 2ndC AD when it is likely that at least one, possibly both, of the temples were constructed. The ramparts clearly acted as the temenos for the temple complex and may have been modified on the inner face by the construction of a chalk wall. Whilst the lower silts of the ditch contained a few pieces of prehistoric pottery, the upper fills produced large amounts of Romano-British material, including concentrations of animal remains, principally fragments of cattle skulls and sheep mandibles, indicative of ritual activity.  The final phases of Roman activity within the hillfort are also evidenced by finds of coins and pottery dating to the 3rd/4th centuries. The polygonal shrine may have been destroyed by c.AD300, and the nature of 4thC AD activity within the hillfort is uncertain.",

It was suggested then that a villa was the identity of the structure. Further excavations in the 1920s and 1970s, revealed more of the building indicating that it might be a Romano-Celtic temple rather than a villa.  The 1920s excavations produced remains of three floors, one tessellated and lying three feet higher than the other two, one of which was surfaced with opus signinum, and a six foot stretch of ragstone walling. The finds were also numerous (see other finds), though some are now difficult to trace, whilst the records of the excavations are largely inadequate.  The 1970s excavators of the site argued that the most likely form of building was that of a Romano-Celtic temple, with its entrance to the east. A newly discovered wall and floor were suggested to be the south side of the ambulatory, making the 1902 tesserae patch the flooring of the cella. Also, two of the gullies identified perhaps belonged to a temenos boundary.  Excavations in 1999 by the Museum or London, Birkbeck College and Time Team, exposed further structural evidence on the mound, as well as remains of a further complex of features to the east, both of which appear to substantiate the temple hypothesis. The complex, disturbed nature of the contexts, plus the limitations of a three-day excavation, meant that it was not possible to phase the site, though the evidence indicates that the site was in use, probably continuously, c.AD100 to AD400, and confirms several phases of activity.  The majority of the pottery dates to the later Roman period, c.AD250-400, whilst most of the building materials were found to be of 1st/2ndC AD date. This suggests that the buildings were in use for a long period, with early building material probably re-used in any repairs or rebuilding.",

The principal features were all Roman in date including a rectangular walled enclosure constructed of 1m-wide chalk walls, measuring 37.0m by 34.60m, which surrounded a robbed stone foundation, possibly a shrine or monumental enclosure. There was an apparent lack of funerary features, though a cremation burial and a votive vessel seem to belong to the later 'farmstead' phase of activity. The pottery evidence suggests that this structure was not built before the Flavian period.  In the late 2ndC AD the enclosure was re-established as part of a farmstead. A corn drier, rubbish pits and a concentration of postholes, probably the remains of several timber buildings, were present within it. A roundhouse outside the walled enclosure was in use in the late 2nd to 4thC AD. Several ditches outside the enclosure provided evidence of field boundaries and the site lay east of a Roman road, encountered during the evaluation of the site, running north-west from the small town of Vagniacis at Springhead.  The ditches were backfilled in the later 3rd century AD with dumped material which included debris from ironworking taking place nearby. All the features within the walled enclosure were excavated but the walls themselves were largely preserved beneath the new school building.",

The late Iron Age/Romano-British settlement is characterised by both rectilinear and curvilinear enclosures with a complex of ditches indicating land boundaries and field-systems. Domestic activity is evidenced by material from pits, pit-complexes and post-holes.  In the earlier phase of the site, a small cremation cemetery was present to the south of the southern-most enclosure. Also, some of the pits in the settlement may have included structured deposits. One included a large sandstone block, sculpted into a half-disk shape and deliberately placed upright into the side of the feature. Another pit included a complete decorated Samian bowl, and a third a small complete vessel. These pits were excavated together within an otherwise featureless rectangular enclosure. It is possible that this was a ritual enclosure (though not suggested by the excavator).  During the later phase, a new set of curvilinear ditches are cut across the site, reforming land boundaries in places, and some appear to delineate a causeway.  A double-ditched enclosure dating to the early-mid Saxon period (AD550-700) suggests possible continuity of settlement at the site.  No finds analysis is given in the report.",

These relate to three main separate finds.  Firstly, a group of seven olla pots, each containing puppy bones from single individuals in association with charcoal, were recovered during the 1950s. It was apparent that these were placed, without lids and open to the elements, within the marshes. All the charcoal contained within the pots derived from twigs and light branches rather than chips or large timbers. This suggested to the author that the material had been specifically chosen for burning. However, none of the infant dog remains had been burnt, indicating that the charcoal had been paced in the urns with the bodies after firing. Such treatment of infant dogs is very rare.  This find followed the discovery in 1864 of an urn nearby containing a silver armilla, two silver finger rings with red carnelian intaglios, with coins of both silver and bronze ranging from Nero to Faustina the Younger. The finds, other than the coins, are held in the British Museum.  And finally, a hoard of 37 sestertii found in 1950 100 feet SE of the find spot of the 1864 treasure hoard in a bellied olla, said to be of local manufacture. The coins range from Domitian to Commodus.  All the finds give a close date for deposition to the end of the 2nd C. The site type has been loosely recorded here as 'shrine'. However, the area is also argued to be the site of significant industrial activity concerning pottery and salt production (see Noel Hume I. 1954, Romano-British potteries on the Upchurch Marshes. Arch. Cant. LXVIII, 72-90).",

In the Mid to Late Iron Age, the area was selected for chalk quarrying, after which the fissures began to infill naturally. A further 300 years on, this seemingly isolated and still-wooded part of the Thanet ridge was used as the site of a possible early Roman pit shrine, perhaps being symbolically marked by structured deposition of animal remains.

The settlement included both enclosed and unenclosed elements, as well as a possible cremation cemetery and other evidence for religious and 'ritual' activity. Between AD10-50, two warrior-burials within square-ditched enclosures were placed in the settlement area. The warrior-burial graves became a focus for activity in the second half of the 1stC AD, and a number of structures were identified. Part of the complex may have formed a shrine.  Initial assessment suggests that a restructuring of the site took place, with regularly placed plots to the south of the trackway, the formalization of the trackway and a re-defining of the enclosed space to the south of the warrior burials. It is suggested that the site during this period was still primarily associated with religious and/or funerary concerns. A large number of contexts contained small quantities of animal bone, the majority being from sheep/goat, with some pig, and at least some immature individuals.  During this time, occupation on the site generally appears to have diminished and little sign of activity can be recognised after the early to mid-2ndC AD. This phase appears to coincide with an increase in occupational activity at the nearby nucleated settlement at Westhawk Farm, c.750m to the east.",

Large roof-tiles, Samian ware, other pottery and glass were found, whilst stone-lined water tanks were also a feature of the site. The extent of the original excavations is not known.  A report on the early excavations was compiled by Cooper et al. (1984), which brought together all the known information on the Roman villa at its associated finds, including a previously unpublished report by the Rev. T S Cooper on his excavations from 1888 onwards.  The plan of the villa is thought to resemble that at Titsey, but it is clear that a number of building phases are involved. A programme of fieldwalking, topographic and geophysical survey, and two phases of trial trenching between 2002 and 2010 established the correct position of the villa and found that the foundations had been completely robbed away during the 19thC.  This later work, however, also identified a late Iron Age enclosure with paddocks and trackway. These features were largely superseded by a new enclosure for a large timber building. These then go out of use by the mid-late 3rdC AD and are replaced by the subsequent masonry villa complex excavated in the 19thC, though this is also thought to have had several phases of construction.  On its elevated hillside location, the site commands extensive views of the surrounding landscape including Hascombe hillfort. No other Roman-period sites are known from the immediate vicinity and the nearest known main road lies c.12km to the east. The site does lie, however, very close to the River Arun, and a spring is also noted further down the slope. Bird (2002) argues that, along with some of the associated finds, the landscape context and unusual plan of the building complex indicates that the site is a religious one rather than a secular one.",

The main features of the site included a number of large pits and deep shafts producing a wide range of finds, including rotary querns, loomweights, spindlewhorls. The pits were cut in sometime during the 1stC AD (either LIA or ERB) and filled in a structured manner.  Along with these artefacts, several variously articulated groups of animal bones had been deposited, together with a late 1st/early 2ndC AD cremation burial of a young male who had been accompanied by nine inscribed bone gaming counters and a tenth made of pottery. Some of the counters had been graffiti scratched to denote the name 'Remus'.  A cremated and urned sheep or goat was also recovered in one of the latest fills of the pit features, also dating to the 2ndC AD.  The features are similar to the ritual shafts present at Keston villa, Kent, and the finds of pink wall plaster and an iron slide key perhaps suggest that these features formed part of a domestic settlement. The categorisation of the site here as a 'shrine' must be taken as tentative with the limited area of excavation, but the site would have overlooked the nearby roadside settlement at Ewell.",

        "Notes": "The Roman temple at Farley Heath has been known since the middle of the 19th century. It is a relatively isolated rural site, positioned at the northern edge of one of the Greensand Hills. The ground to the south is fairly level, but on the other three sides it drops away quite rapidly, and there is an uninterrupted view towards the North Downs.  In the early 1990s, substantial damage began to be caused by metal-detectorists and there followed excavation by Surrey County Archaeological Unit, funded by English Heritage, in order to record the surviving stratigraphy before further destruction took place. The 2007 SyAC report presents the results of these excavations alongside earlier investigations on the site, and a comprehensive publication of the large and important collection of Roman finds from previous work is provided.  The site first saw activity from, at least, the Neolithic period and, it was argued, that the context of pre-Roman activity was ritual due to the distinct hilltop location of the site. The quantity of finds shows that later Iron Age ritual activity took place, although a physical shrine was not constructed in that period, as with similar sites which are later developed into a Romano-Celtic temple.  Whilst the site continued in use throughout the Roman period, the date of temple and temenos construction could not be accurately established. The temple was of the common cella and ambulatory type, while the temenos is unique in Britain, forming an irregular polygon, which enclosed some 1.2ha. South and west of the temenos a variety of evidence has been recovered pointing to industrial and, perhaps, settlement activity.  Two 'ovens or kilns for baking pottery' were found to the north-west of the temple enclosure in the 19thC, whilst a third was excavated in the 1930s containing 4thC AD pottery to the south of the first two. Others have been noted in the area, and may have been destroyed.  The site appears not to have seen much activity after the Roman period and prior to extensive robbing of its stone from the later 17th century onwards. However, it seems that some memory of its religious purpose was retained over this long period.",

        "Notes": "Lying perhaps due north of the centre of the roadside settlement at Ewell, the King William IV site provided evidence of multiple phases of activity from the Neolithic to the post-medieval period. Several phases of Roman occupation were identified dating from the 1st-4th centuries AD. The site lies on the line of Stane Street, though the Roman road was not found in the excavation. It was hypothesised that the road had been diverted around the site, perhaps because of a sacred importance of the area.  The earliest sign of activity on the site, post-Bronze Age, is a possible cremation burial which had been badly disturbed. It was uncertain whether this was late Iron Age or early Roman in date. By the late 1stC AD four pits and a building with an associated mortared floor, perhaps of light timber-build, were constructed.  After demolition, this building was superseded by one or more buildings denoted by a number of large postholes. These features were accompanied by a number of pits and a well. Evidence of a possible masonry structure also dated to the late 2ndC AD and a possible corn-dryer was dated to the early-mid3rdC AD.  A major organisational change apparently took place in the late 3rd/early 4thC AD with a well being backfilled. A coin hoard was placed in the primary deposit of the well, c.AD280, with pottery in the layers built up above, c.AD250-350. Debris from a nearby masonry structure also appears to have been placed in the well, as well as jewellery and animal bone.  Little evidence for Roman activity is noted after this phase apart from coin and pottery finds, including Portchester D ware, from soil layers.  A number of animal burials were also placed on site, some dated as Roman, though most were not datable (see zooarchaeological data). These may relate to the proposed Roman-period sacred associations of the site.  Middle Saxon activity is later noted by the appearance of chaff-tempered ware.",

        "Notes": "Located on Hayling Island on the south coast within the Portsmouth/Chichester Harbour estuary complex, the site of a late Iron Age shrine and subsequent Romano-Celtic temple (derivative?) was excavated between 1976 and 1981. The site is said to be situated on high ground and the shrine/temple is likely to have been visible from the Chichester-Winchester Road on the mainland. The presence of the religious site and the apparent lack of settlement evidence on Hayling has led to the suggestion that the Island itself was a sacred place.  The middle of the 1stC BC saw the construction of an open-air enclosure set within an outer enclosure, which later saw the replacement of the inner enclosure with a sub-circular structure focussed upon a large pit, identified as the foundation of the shrine. Evidence for the zonation of deposits, including coinage, metalwork and faunal remains, demonstrate the ritual character of the site.  The late Iron Age shrine later gets replaced and rebuilt around AD60 by a circular Roman temple set within a colonnaded temenos, possibly with a much larger outer 'temenos' boundary ditch (identified by geophysical survey). The Roman temple is said to have had significant links with Gaul in terms of its architectural form and construction style. The site goes out of use soon after AD200, though quantities of late Roman coinage suggests later activity in some form. A middle Saxon settlement was also evident over the site.  An evaluation and watching brief during the laying of a pipeline c.160m to the north of the site revealed evidence of Roman period land-use and a cremation burial.",

The extent of the ranges was greatly increased, with fine mosaics, hypocausts and two separate bath suites. A nymphaeum shrine was built in the corner on the site of the main spring, with an octagonal basin. Chi-Rho symbols inscribed into 3 of the basin coping stones indicates later Christian use. Other buildings known in and around the Combe were part of the wider estate. A Romano-Celtic temple lay 900m to SE on a hillslope overlooking the Coln (see ID 14072), and a building was found 155m NW of the villa on the ridge overlooking the combe, which may well have been a mausoleum, though evidence is lacking. The villa was at its most developed in the mid 4th C AD, after which there was a decline, though (inferior quality) mosaics still being laid in late 4th C AD. A hearth later built on top of a mosaic and evidence for industrial activity. It probably survived as an agricultural centre well into the 5th C AD, even if the opulence had long gone.",

A series of postholes towards the centre appear to have been part of a square structure (8.2m sq.), with a central pit. At a later point (mid/later 1st C AD), the whole complex was re-modified with a possible second structure positioned over the northern enclosure ditches, along with a clay-lined pit. Structured deposits occur within some of the enclosure ditches and pits. At some point in the early/mid 2nd century AD, the site appears to have been levelled, and replaced by a substantial masonry Romano-Celtic sub-type of temple and surrounding ancillary buildings, sharing a similar orientation to their structural predecessors. A large masonry building, interpreted as a guesthouse, lay to the north, while to the SW and SE were two further multi-roomed buildings. One later building was probably used in the production of cast-copper alloy rings. Geophysical survey indicated further elements of the complex spread over 8-9ha. The buildings were all subject to much change and development from the 2nd to 4th C AD, including adding a podium to the front of the temple. The final structural phase of the temple (c AD 380) resulted from its partial collapse and subsequent 'L-shaped' form, utilising the remaining ambulatory corridors. This phase appears to continue into the early 5th C AD. Evidence from the cult statue and many curse tablets indicates the primary deity worshiped at this complex was Mercury.",

The building is broadly square in plan and includes a central pit, thought by the original excavator to have been a piscina, though the area included Roman pottery and evidence of burning. The building had flanking rooms on either side. The discovery of a nearby palisade, said to have been dismantled by the 3rdC AD, possibly delimits a temenos, though may simply enclose the site in general. Coins and other materials are also noted from the site, as is the finding of a mosaic floor in the vicinity.  Evaluation trenching on an immediately nearby site revealed further evidence of Roman activity from possibly associated features including linear features and postholes, perhaps defining fence boundaries. Finds included painted wall plaster, opus signinum, glass and CBM. The pottery assemblage is small but suggests 2nd-4thC AD activity.",

The settlements were situated next to two Bronze Age barrows. The Iron Age settlement was particularly long-lived stretching from the 7thC BC to the 1stC BC though is thought to have ceased by 100BC since no late pre-Roman finds were recovered from the site. The Romano-British occupation of the site seems to have been a clean break with the Iron Age settlement. A late 1st/early 2ndC AD square ditch was dug, appearing to enclose the area with the Bronze Age barrows. The eastern-most barrow ditch was later filled in, possibly as late as the 4thC AD, and a square structure was constructed directly over the top. This structure seems likely to have been a shrine considering its association with the barrow. Marine shells, Roman pottery and artefacts were found in the fills of the ditch and the building's postholes. An associated pit included similar material and part of a human skull which may have been redeposited from an earlier burial.",

The temple was positioned just to the north of a large, prominent Bronze Age round barrow and was thought to have been constructed during the early 4th c AD (possibly as late as AD 330-40). A porch and two side annexes were clearly later additions and a metalled trackway is thought to have led away from the building. The temple walls were faced with dressed limestone blocks, with painted plaster patches. The later chronology is confusing, but it appears that the temple was in a state of disrepair c. AD 370-80, with part of it possibly being re-used for a free-standing southern building (on a different alignment) dated c AD 400. It is unsure whether this represented a final religious phase at the site, as it has been interpreted as both a Christian and pagan shrine. However, the presence of later occupation debris in the southern structure and ironworking (smelting) debris in the north-western ambulatory points to eventual domestic/industrial activity. The final deliberate dismantlement of the temple was likely to have been well into the 5th century, as a worn coin of Theodosius was found sealed under the destruction debris.",

The earliest occupation is dated to the late Bronze Age, though the main period of occupation was the middle to late Iron Age (c 300 BC - AD 40/50), with evidence for roundhouses and rock-cut storage pits. The outer lines of the ramparts are dated to this phase, along with a complex sequence of gate structures. It seems that the intensity of occupation had begun to decline before the start of the 1st C AD, with a lack of circular buildings and a relative paucity of pits in the areas excavated; many cattle were buried in a specific zone within the central plateau area that had previously been used for metalworking, all lying to the south of deposits of metalwork. A rectangular two-celled timber structure defined by a continuous bedding trench with postholes (3.4x4.6m) in this central plateau may well be a shrine belonging to this late Iron Age/early Roman phase. The inner rampart and gateway were refurbished at some point during the 1st  AD, although later in this century (c AD 60?) there are signs of destruction with indications of Roman military activity against the hillfort occupants. After this destruction, a roadway was laid out, the gate passage refurbished and 3 timber military barracks built in the interior, possibly part of a small fort built into the NE quadrant of the hillfort (occupied by a mixed legionary and auxiliary cavalry detachment). All activity appears to have ceased by the end of the 1st C AD. There is no firm evidence for re-occupation until the post-Roman period (later 5th C +), although there are some signs of activity dating to the 3rd/4th C, including building material that suggests a late Roman phase somewhere within an unexcavated part of the hillfort.",

The character and form of the Roman settlement established in the later 1st/2nd C AD was difficult to determine, but it appears to have significantly expanded during the later Roman period with several (4+) substantial buildings with mortared stone walls and stone tiled roofs. One two-roomed building contained two hearths, flagstone floor and a pit containing three sheep burials. Elsewhere there are hints of timber-framed structures, cobbled yards and a framework of ditched enclosures. Fieldwalking suggested the settlement spread over 3ha at its maximum.

The temenos entrance, situated in middle of the eastern range, was aligned directly with that of the temple, and a stone lined well was located an analogous distance behind this, along the same alignment. A curious apsidal foundation in the NE corner of the precinct may have been an altar or a shrine.  The chronology of the complex is understood from both the general date range of the artefact assemblage, and a few specifically stratified coins, indicating a construction date in the late 3rd C AD. Structural renovations occurred within the temple in the last quarter of the 4th C AD, and a very worn coin of Flavius Victor (AD 383-8) found underneath the rubble suggests that activity continued well into the 5th century.

The site remained unoccupied until the later Roman period, when a number of pits, heaths and postholes recorded within and outside the enclosure (which was probably still a feature). An oval gully (7.1x8.2m) within the enclosure may have been a shrine. Two pits at its southern end contained a collection of rare structured deposits including an iron saw, bucket handles, animal bone, iron nails and steelyard balance in one and a shale spindle whorl, quern fragment, pottery, animal bone, hobnail and Neolithic flint core in the other. An inhumation grave also discovered  on the edge of the former enclosure. A well-preserved T-shaped corn-drying oven also found built into the hollow of the silted up enclosure ditch. Early Saxon pottery and a radiocarbon date (AD 335-535) suggested continued activity into the 5th C.

        "Notes": "Site of a major Iron Age hillfort with Neolithic origins, some late Iron Age/early Roman occupation and an important late/post-Roman centre.  The hillfort was originally excavated by Mortimer Wheeler in the first half of the 20thC and then re-excavated as part of a wider landscape survey in the middle of the 1980s. The Wheeler excavations were more extensive than the later works, though both were located predominantly in the eastern part of the hillfort.  Several phases of occupation and development can be discerned. The hillfort was intensively occupied during the middle Iron Age with nucleated settlement and other features covering the full extent of the enclosed area, with domestic plots lining an apparent street grid. This period also featured the modification of the external bank and ditch system into its most complex form. However, a major change in the organisation of the settlement took place into the late Iron Age. Occupation was dramatically reduced and appeared to be generally confined to the eastern half of the hillfort. Many of the trackways went out of use, though one at least appeared to be remetalled during this period. A circular stone structure dated to this period of occupation, with associated features and material including a central hearth and a considerable quantity of LIA pottery. Although not specified by the excavator, this structure has later been suggested to have been a shrine due to the recovery of brooches, finger rings, a bronze needle, a small number of late Iron Age coins, horse gear, chariot fittings, weaponry, and the incomplete leg bones of a pony. Together these are thought to be similar to the depositional practices found at Hayling Island (Drury 1980; Wait 1985).  The eastern entranceway was metalled for the first time in the LIA. Behind the eastern entrance, at least four roundhouses were constructed, around which a thick layer of ash was identified, most likely relating to industrial metal-working. Cut into the ash layer were several burials identified by Wheeler as a 'war cemetery' associated with the Roman conquest. The cemetery dated to the Iron Age/Romano-British transition and some of the inhumations, less than half, included evidence for violent death, though Sharples argues that they should not necessarily be seen as evidence for engagement with the Roman military.  A similar re-organisation of settlement into the late Iron Age was also identified at Danebury, but there the site was abandoned shortly after this phase. The evidence from Maiden Castle is suggested to retained an element of prestige. Occupation here, however, continued briefly into the Roman period, perhaps to the end of the 1stC AD. This phase was evidence by a rectangular post-built structure and pit features. It is uncertain whether this occupation was of a civilian or military nature. Abandonment soon after this phase was contemporary with the establishment and early development of Durnovaria, the Roman town underlying modern Dorchester.  The construction of a 4thC AD Romano-Celtic temple signified a new phase of significant use at the site. The building comprised a central block, or cella, surrounded by a corridor or veranda, within a walled precinct. The cella may have had a black and white mosaic floor, while the corridor had a red tessellated pavement. The structure was built of flint and limestone and roofed with stone tiles, later replaced by clay. It appears that the site became an important religious focus into the post-Roman period as evidenced by the burial of a number of early Saxon inhumations.",

No known parallels can be found in the region for this site and the excavators favour a religious function for the site. However, there is little evidence for pits or votive deposits which would mark the site out as religious. The deposit of a carefully placed pig skull and a small pit with sheep bones may be of ritual character. Two large coin hoards had been found in the immediate area previous to discovery of the site. However, no other features were identified which might mark the site out as secular in function, i.e. no kilns or corndriers.  Other than two IA coins and an issue of Tiberius, the coin list dates exclusively to the late 3rd and 4thC AD. However, the Samian ware is late 1st and 2ndC AD though these were entirely from reworked contexts suggestive of an earlier phase of activity.",

It was notable that the majority of material was of Roman date, though some earlier finds were recovered. The nature of the activity is difficult to define, but some domestic occupation is thought probable, and burials outside the cave, at least one of which seems to be Romano-British, perhaps strengthen this idea. It was notable, however, that the metalwork from the cave was of outstanding quality - especially the brooches, and Branigan and Bayley suggest that the cave was used for metalworking (as they also suggest for Poole's Cavern, Buxton). Branigan et al dismiss the suggestion that there may therefore be a ritual element to the activity, though the site has been characterised as a potential shrine here, as some have suggested a ritual use. The distribution of the finds was considered important - most of the quality metalwork was from the slope outside the cave. Branigan and Dearne suggest a chronology for the use of the cave as late 1st century AD to mid-to-late 3rd century.",

The site is known predominantly from metal-detected finds, but geophysical survey has revealed that the findspots are clustered around a circular feature around 12m in diameter.  The survey also showed a number of linear features which may be related to a contemporary settlement. A long tradition of non-ferrous metalworking at the site is suggested by the recovery of over 200 pieces of silver, lead and copper alloy casting waste; a preliminary investigation of the horse and rider brooches (Fillery-Travis 2008) revealed generally low quality production and an absence of lugs to attach pins on the majority of examples, which might suggest that they were produced especially for deposition.  In the context of the metalworking evidence, it is possible that some of this production took place at the site itself, which would be unique in Roman Britain.",

The site is a late Iron Age ritual complex, the focus of which was a boundary ditch (perhaps polygonal) and entrance. Dating evidence indicates that the primary activity occurred during the first century BC and the first century AD. Intermittent activity occurred from at least the Bronze Age and continued to the late Roman period, although the ritual space is thought only to have been in use for around a hundred years at most, with the main deposition of coins and artefacts spanning a relatively short time (perhaps 20-30 years), in the early to mid-first century AD, although the earliest deposition of coins is likely to have been in the mid-to-late first century BC. The latest coin from any of the hoards is of Claudius, and gives a terminus post quem of c. AD 41/42. Principal ritual deposits included 14 late Iron Age coin hoards, some of them containing denarii, deposits of pig bones, and metalwork which included a Roman cavalry helmet and a silver bowl. The earliest coins deposited were recovered from an area of 'blank' ritual space, whilst other later structured deposits were recovered from the boundary ditch and the entranceway later became the focus for the deposition of 14 hoards of coins. A dog burial may also have been placed in the area of an early form of the entrance, and other dog burials are also known from the ditch.  A number of discrete pits to the east of the entrance were a focus for the deposition of large numbers of animal parts, predominantly young pig. Later mid/later first to second century AD activity included two possible round houses in a large rectangular enclosure indicating possible domestic activity at the site. Other objects suggest continued ritual activity at the site up to the second century AD, perhaps in a different area from the late Iron Age site. Possible ritual deposits up to the fourth century may have occurred, but seem to have avoided the earlier ritual focus.",

A corndrier and a structure interpreted as a likely malting kiln have been identified. Eight RB inhumations were excavated. Excavation ahead of installation of a pipeline in 1997 by APS revealed IA ditches and gullies (probably land boundaries or drainage), eaves drip gullies for two timber built huts, a possible trackway, late IA finewares, a rectangular enclosure, a Roman masonry building (at an oblique angle to the Roman road) with an external paved area.

Finds included buildings and a rich and varied finds assemblage. The site was initially identified during archaeological work associated with a British Gas pipeline and the initial investigations included geophysical survey and fieldwalking. Amateur metal detecting had also occurred at the site since the 1980s, and some finds were available for study. The earliest evidence included a Neolithic ceremonial landscape, and Bronze Age and mid and late Iron Age deposits and finds were also recovered. The site appears to have been a ritual focus in the Iron Age which continued into the Roman period, though there is evidence for extensive domestic activity as well. During the Roman period stone buildings lining the route of Caistor High Street \u0013 a likely prehistoric trackway and Roman road. Features identified during geophysics include extensive land divisions as well as back-lanes beyond the enclosures. These seem to represent a coherent system of property boundaries fronting onto the road. Three stone founded buildings were identified, apparently part of a formalised settlement lay-out on an approximate east-west alignment. These were of mortared construction and all were aisled buildings; one was situated within its own compound. At least one produced evidence for an earlier timber phase. Postholes also suggest other structures. One aisled building was 8.45m x at least 18m. It is thought that roofs were of thatch or timber as little ceramic tile was recovered. A corndrier was located in one of the trenches, apparently of late Roman date. Whilst not recovered during the excavation, there is a local belief that a mosaic was found at the site \u0013 suggested that this may have been associated with a mansion or a villa. One enclosure complex was regarded as unusual for a roadside settlement, resembling a separate farm unit or a shrine or temple, though no evidence amongst the finds supports this suggestion. However, an exceptional group of coins and small metal objects are known from the site, including items of miniature martial equipment and an inscribed lead curse tablet, suggesting the existence of a shrine, though this was not located during the excavations.  As well as the evidence from the small finds, structured deposition is potentially represented by the inverted skull of a horse, found in the fill of a ditch. Major reorganisation of the site may have occurred during the early Roman period, and it is not certain that there was direct occupation at the site before the mid-1st century AD, though votive activity appears to have occurred long before this, and it is thought probable that there would have been at least some domestic activity in the late Iron Age. Occupation at the site came to an abrupt end in the first half of the fourth century AD and there is no evidence for post-Roman occupation.",

        "Notes": "The site of mid-late Iron Age settlement with a potential religious focus, an early-mid Roman farmstead of some standing, and a 4thC AD villa. The site is located centrally within Purbeck, sandwiched between the chalk of Corfe Ridge to the north and the coastal limestone escarpment to the south, and lies close to Corfe River which runs north to Poole Harbour.  After sporadic earlier prehistoric evidence, an unbroken sequence of occupation took place from the middle Iron Age to the end of the Roman period. The earliest activity in this sequence is represented by 'special deposits' which was added to in the late Iron Age with the construction of a barrow sealing the middle Iron Age deposits and a LIA Durotrigian female inhumation. Four roundhouses were constructed during the LIA, the lack of domestic evidence from which led the excavators to argue that at least one of the structures may have been a shrine. Along with some further structures, these features were set within two palisaded enclosures. By the middle of the 1stC AD, the site was receiving imported goods such as terra nigra, amphorae, vessel glass and brooches, suggesting that it was enveloped within the local trading network characteristic of the Poole Harbour area.  The late 1st/early 2ndC AD is marked by the construction of a number of rectangular masonry buildings. The most notable of these was an aisled hall which respected the layout of the Iron Age enclosures. Other structures included a possible bathhouse and a building with a corndrier. To the south, further masonry buildings were found in an area noted for a concentration of infant burials. In the late 2nd or early 3rdC AD an open-sided rectangular building accompanied by stone-lined tanks was found, and in the middle of the 3rdC AD three new masonry structures of 'agricultural type' were constructed. These were similar in plan, though one included a small room which contained a 'special deposit' containing complete glass vessels, metal objects, shale furniture (possibly seats) and animal bone (see fish bone!). Evidence for occupation in the southern area had ceased by the end of the 3rdC AD.  At this time a new 'row-type' building was constructed in the 'aisled building area' along with another structure containing a corndrier. Shortly after, a period of major architectural investment ensued as the existing buildings developed into a courtyard villa. The bathhouse was remodelled and enlarged, the row-type building was extended and a hypocaust inserted, and the aisled hall was repositioned and reconstructed. All three buildings were then linked by a corridor. The complex was notable for simple rather than fine mosaic flooring and wall plastering, though other indications of status are noted by the range and quantity of coinage and fish bones. The fourth side of the complex was occupied by a long 'open' building, thought to have been a 'work hall'. This building was reconstructed at least twice and was added to by further corndriers placed within and outside the buildings. Based upon coin and pottery evidence the settlement may have been abandoned by the last quarter of the 4thC AD.",

There were also two cists within the fill which held a range of artefacts.

Overlying the shaft was a structure, interpreted as the cella of a Roman-Celtic Temple, with stone footings and an entrance to the south, whilst a thin concrete surface on the external sides is thought to have been the remains of a pavement for a colonnade or portico.

The excavations revealed the main villa house, which incorporated a bath suite, and which was constructed in the mid-2nd century. A timber shrine and various agricultural buildings were also probably associated with the villa at this time, as was the construction of an enclosure wall. A possible earlier phase (perhaps beginning in the late 1st or 2nd century) was represented by a single-roomed house which was extended during the 2nd century. The baths, and probably the main house, fell into disuse in the late 2nd century and were demolished. The site was then reorganised with the construction of a stone-built Romano-Celtic temple, a new substantial enclosure wall, and a new agricultural building in the late 2nd century, and the original more simple house may now have been the only domestic building. At around AD 280 there were alterations to the temple. During the third and fourth centuries the simple house and agricultural buildings fell into disuse, although the temple may still have been standing post-AD 400.

A roundhouse and a pottery kiln then dated from the mid-1st century AD.

These had fallen out of use by around AD 225. By the late 3rd or 4th century another circular and crude round houses was built close to the site where the stone buildings had been.  Unusually shaped pits and a small enclosure of uncertain function were interpreted by the excavator as possible evidence for a ritual focus, although the evidence for this is tenuous. Odd groups of animal bones were also seen as potentially representative of ritual deposition.",

Further excavations occurred in 1981-4, primarily with the aim of putting the finds from the earlier digging into some sort of context.

The Roman artefacts belong predominantly to the 2nd and early 3rd century AD. The cave has been variously interpreted as a \"\"shrine\"\", with an emphasis on deposition of metalwork within a pool inside the cave; a \"\"domestic site\"\"; and a place where metalworking was undertaken (this seems like the most convincing interpretation - unfinished brooches and moulds for casting of fibulae were recovered. It has been suggested that the cave was particularly attractive as a workshop as a result of the stable temperature - an advantage in casting Bronze.).

The temple was of Romano-Celtic type, with the addition of symmetrically placed annexes on either side of the entrance and a sunken room leading off from the southern ambulatory. The surrounding ambulatory was divided into four rooms, two of which contained votive pits (with animal bone, some burnt); the western room contained a centrally-placed hearth. A small pot containing burnt soil and a 2nd C AD coin was sealed by a limestone floor slab in this room. The temple's construction has been dated to the late 3rd C by a stratified coin of Carausius and seem to have continued in use at least until the end of the 4th C AD. The only other structure at the site was a free standing rectangular building (with well-constructed mortared masonry) near to the temple, which overlay a votive pit, but which may have been broadly contemporary. A series of pits to the north of the temple contained at least nine antler burials, and as this was the only flat open area on the ridge, it is likely that it was used for the main cult rituals. A small post-Roman cemetery lay in this area. The temple lay c 7km east of the Fosse Way, with a branch road leading directly to the site, providing an indication of its importance.",

        "Notes": "The site of a 'round' at Trethurgy, an especially important site as it is the first example to have seen complete excavation. The univallate enclosure is situated 4km NE of St Austell, occupying the bottom of a gentle east-facing slope in a slight valley. The site is approx. 4km from the coast at St Austell Bay. The site was excavated in advance of its destruction for a waste tip for china-clay working. The enclosure was 56m x 48m internally, enclosing an area of approx. 0.2ha. The excavation demonstrated that the round had been occupied during the 2nd to 6th centuries AD. A series of structures were revealed, situated around the perimeter of the round, with a central open space. The stratigraphic sequence was complex, and many structures had been rebuilt on the same site several times. The round had been built over an earlier, unfinished, earthwork, possibly a stock enclosure of the late 1st century BC associated with a late-prehistoric fieldsystem.  This early enclosure contained a single insubstantial structure and continued until construction of the round. The round was constructed c. AD 150 and was enclosed by a ditch and rampart, revetted on both faces with stone. It had a single entrance, central to the downhill side, closed by a double-leaved gate. The rampart and entrance were maintained throughout the occupation, but the ditch was disused by the 4th century. The interior contained five large oval stone houses (possible high status dwellings) and a range of ancillary buildings, a four-poster granary, a byre, a probable shrine (constructed c. AD 375-400), and various stores and workshops. Additional buildings included a rectangular timber building constructed during the 2nd century and a late 5th century rectangular stone structure. Approx. three oval timber buildings of various phases were constructed, as well as three small sub-circular and four irregular oval buildings in stone. The probable shrine was a polygonal structure, 1.8 by 1.5m, defined by orthostats, and a worn path led to it. It was interpreted as such based on its position directly uphill, although not facing, the entrance, the lack of good evidence for a utilitarian function and the presence of a double handful of sea sand in the bedding for the paving in the structure. The paving in the structure surrounded a central gap, thought possibly to have been a deliberate space for deposition of offerings (perhaps liquid?) which have not survived (and it should be noted that bone did not survive well due to the acidic soil conditions). It is thought that the structure may have existed throughout the use of the round, with remodelling only in the late 4th century. Not all buildings were contemporary, but the basic plan continued through the centuries, with houses rebuilt in situ and the same areas used for penning stock, storage, outside activities and rubbish disposal. The changing use of the buildings formed a complex sequence, with a major period of rebuilding in the late 3rd to early 4th century. The report suggests the site may have seen maximum residential capacity during the 2nd century and again in the late 4th century. There was a gradual decline through the 5th century with a little increase in the 6th. Rubbish had generally been systematically removed from the site, and so artefacts were relatively sparse for the area excavated. A single midden provided the only large group of associated finds. There was some evidence for structured deposition in the form of a remarkable range of ceramics in the 6th century (deliberate?) infill of the structure interpreted as a shrine (including samian and post-Roman imports). Also possible examples of structured deposition signalling closure of houses \u0013 pottery and a weight associated with a pit at the time when a house went out of use, and a pit near the structure interpreted as a granary containing a saddle quern and other probable grain-processing tools. Evidence for small-scale production of copper-alloy and probably silver artefacts as well as smithing of iron.",

The site has produced considerable evidence for prehistoric occupation in the form of multiple stone buildings dating from the Bronze Age, though there is much less evidence for domestic occupation during the Roman period, and it is unclear whether the settlement was occupied continuously from the Bronze Age into the Roman period, though this is regarded as a possibility. In particular, one of the stone built houses produced a hearth with a C14 date and magnetic dating suggesting activity between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, and large assemblages of Roman period finds were retrieved from in and around the Bronze Age houses, including figurines and an unusually large quantity of brooches and coins. All Roman activity appears to have occurred in features at the west of the site.  The original excavation report interpreted the site as a brooch production site, but this interpretation has been challenged and the site is instead regarded as a shrine during the Roman period rather than a domestic settlement, and some internal structures within one of the buildings may have been added in the Roman period, associated with ritual activity. These included a large circular 'table' in the centre of one of the buildings and a triangular stone 'box' nearby, and finds were associated with these features. As well as the coins, brooches and figurines, artefacts with a likely ritual significance include miniature pots. As at least three of the buildings appear to have seen some reuse in the Roman period they have been included here under circular buildings, but they are likely to have had a much earlier construction date. The date of ritual activity suggested by the artefacts ranges from the 1st to 4th centuries AD.",

The site is positioned on the southern slopes of a spur of land to the immediate west of Penryn, overlooking the town and with far reaching views to the south and distantly out to sea. Previous geophysical survey results included a possible late prehistoric/Iron Age enclosure and what appeared to be an intriguing series of concentric ditches. The trenching identified the concentric ditches to be of late Iron Age or Roman date, formed by three ditches and a gully, and one of the ditches apparently had a stone-revetted bank on its exterior. A vertical sided pit was located within the structure formed by these ditches. There is likely to be a relationship between these features and contemporaneous activity to the north at sites recorded as database numbers 18029 and 18030. The site is currently without a precise parallel in Cornwall. The range of pottery suggested a date of around the first century AD. The function of the site is uncertain, though it is suggested in the report that it may have been a ceremonial enclosure, and it has therefore been classified as a potential shrine here, though firm evidence for this is lacking.",

        "Notes": "An immensely important site consisting of a Roman villa and associated estate, situated on the west side of Stanwick, occupying a gravel terrace on the east bank of the River Nene. The site was subject to extensive excavation ahead of gravel extraction. The site is especially complex and 201 buildings were recorded, including 20 building complexes with 62 circular timber houses, 30 circular masonry houses, 10 rectangular timber houses, 39 rectangular masonry houses, 56 four-post structures interpreted as granaries and 4 six-post structures.  27 wells were also discovered, as well as 17 corn dryers. Activity at the site began in the late Iron Age, dating from at least circa 100 BC, and probably earlier. Even earlier activity at the site included a Bronze Age barrow, notably later enclosed by a Roman temenos. Several Iron Age coins and brooches were recovered. The IA site can possibly be divided into two areas, with an area of around 3ha with a high concentration of ring-ditches lying close to the river and occupying an area of higher ground, possibly separated from the eastern part of the site by a palaeochannel. A droveway may have passed through this complex. Not all of these circular buildings were contemporaneous, but many are likely to have been. An enclosure was added to this area during a second phase, and individual enclosed farmsteads may have developed. By the later 1st century AD the site appears to have been a series of individual ditched enclosures and there seems to have been direct continuity from the late Iron Age. By the 2nd century the site appears to have been remodelled, with the construction of a series of rectilinear ditched enclosures which may have originated from the earlier enclosures. Some of these enclosures were separated by trackways. By the 2nd century masonry circular houses had been introduced and were found in most enclosures. Most building complexes had their own wells. By the 4th century many of the enclosure ditches had been replaced by walled boundaries. The individual complexes had different fortunes, and 3 of the complexes show development from circular to rectangular forms, and one of these may have had an administrative function. One complex, which began as a group of circular houses, had an aisled hall built in the 3rd century, which subsequently was enlarged with a cross range and a bath suite added, and became the main building at the complex with opus signinum floors and painted wall plaster. By the late fourth century a major programme of rebuilding converted the house to a winged corridor villa and the bath suite was demolished and replaced. There is evidence for the building having been two storeyed. Five mosaics were found at the site.  None of the other building complexes developed beyond that of a simple farmstead, although notably, new farmsteads were created in the 3rd or 4th centuries. A notable feature of the site is the retention of circular styles of building at many of the site, including some later farmsteads. By the early  5th century the main villa was no longer a luxury house as some of its mosaic floors were cut by corndriers. The bath house was demolished and the space used as a working area.  Post-holes cut some of the buildings and pagan Saxon graves were found. There may have been a shift in economic focus from pastoralism to arable cultivation in the early Roman period. Other features at the site include a Romano-Celtic shrine, apparently focussed on a temenos surrounding a Bronze Age barrow, and a small cemetery. Minor industrial activity included iron smithing (no evidence for smelting) and bone working.",

Poorly reported excavations in the mid-20th century are the primary source, as well as more recent geophysical survey to the west of the temple.  The site is mainly in the area of 'Black Holmes' and 'Black Wang' with a cemetery in the quarry, 'Kirk Hole'. Early finds consisting of coins, pottery and personal objects, were made in 1740 and excavations were carried out in 1884. A Roman well was discovered some time before 1779.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s E. Greenfield excavated the site ahead of quarrying and describes finding 'seven stone buildings, postholes, three wells, a series of gullies, twenty three circular hearths, seventy five pits, sixty two much-used oven bases, twenty six small stone quarries and a cemetery. Clearly, this is a slice across a busy settlement where iron smelting was a major activity'.  A religious focus is indicated by the discovery of a temple building with a temenos ditch enclosing a large area, in the centre of which stood several successive temples. A 1st century AD  circular gully around a limestone floor marks the site of a wooden building rebuilt more than once. It was replaced by a circular structure 41 feet in diameter with stone walls and a crushed stone floor on which stood a cement statue or altar base. In the 2nd century a tessellated floor was inserted, and in the late 3rd century a large basilican temple was constructed on the same site, solidly built of limestone slabs, and porched and divided inside into a nave and side aisles. A series of small holes were dug in the nave to below the level of the round shrine, two containing a silver feather and an inscribed silver plaque, both of votive type. At some time the temple is thought to have been converted to domestic use (although this is questionable) and the floor was raised with rubble which contained building stones and roof tiles, implying destruction of the superstructure of the temple. This occupation lasted until the late 4th or early 5th century. Other discoveries included houses, wells, kilns, many ovens and hearths and burials, suggesting that the site may have been an industrial or agricultural centre as well as religious. Brooches, at least 352 coins and other bronze artefacts have been recovered from the area. The coin finds include two small third century coin hoards. 29 Iron Age coins indicate pre-Roman activity in the area. A stone lined well contained 21 coins and many thousands of animal bones of cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs and other small animals including rodents, organic matter,  fragments of a pewter bowl, much pottery, slag, mussel and oyster shells. The more recent geophysics and fieldwalking revealed one field with exceptionally dense quantities of Roman material culture, including pottery and tap slag indicating iron smelting. The material recovered was predominantly of 3rd and 4th century, perhaps indicating intensification of activity at this time. The geophysics revealed a probable road or track as well as multiple enclosures.",

Excavation, which followed evaluation trenching and geophysics, produced evidence for a mid-Iron Age settlement and Roman settlement including a stone-built circular shrine and enclosures. As the Iron Age activity was some distance from the shine, and did not extend beyond the first century BC (and may be much earlier than this) it has not been included in this record. Approximately 300m to the south-west of the Iron Age settlement was a circular stone building, situated near the centre of a rectangular enclosure formed by a number of gullies. A more substantial enclosure was subsequently built around the stone building, whilst an additional enclosure, containing a small rectangular timber building, was built to the north. The site is interpreted as a Romano-British shrine complex and was probably established in the mid 2nd century AD and continued in use until the late 4th century AD. Between the late 2nd century and 4th century the interior was subdivided by the construction of a timber partition. On one side of the partition there were the partly articulated remains of a young sheep/goat. Additional pits also contained ritual depositions including three small 4th century cups. Lying on the floor of the shrine were up to 50 Roman coins, fragments of glass, several items of jewellery, a lead curse tablet, a fragment of a figurine of Minerva and two spear heads. In the late 4th or 5th century AD (possibly into the 6th century) a young adult male, who had died in his early 30s, was buried in a grave in the centre of the stone building. Articulated animal bones indicate that joints of meat were buried with the individual. The building eventually collapsed or was demolished, the rubble covering the grave and the foundations of the shrine.",

Extensive geophysical survey and fieldwalking indicated an extensive area of archaeological features in the vicinity, provisionally identified as evidence for settlement of Iron Age and Roman date, covering an area of approx. 10ha. Several areas of more intensive activity were defined, including enclosures and possible roundhouses, and large quantities of material were recovered during fieldwalking. The site was seen as a likely farmstead, with activity from the Iron Age into the Roman period. The concentration of Roman pottery occurred predominantly away from the roundhouses, so these may predominantly be Iron Age rather than Roman. The roundhouses identified during the geophysics lay outside the enclosures, which were thought possibly to be stock enclosures. Roof tile and a small amount of tesserae suggest a substantial building somewhere in the vicinity. The site is difficult to classify on morphological grounds - the geophysical survey results are suggestive of linear/developed settlement, although without excavation many of the features are undated, and it is unclear which are contemporary. A recent interpretation of the coins by Hurst and Leins is that they potentially represent deposition in a late Iron Age hilltop religious space.",

In the later 4th century a rectangular stone building was constructed above the earlier ditch complex, and was subsequently extensively modified. The building is thought to have been part of a larger complex. A four post timber structure surrounded by two circular gullies was of uncertain function also belonged to this late phase, and was suggested as a possible shrine, although there is fairly limited evidence other than that coins below packing and post-pipes in the timber structure may have been deliberately deposited.

The site may have been an important junction where the transfer of goods between road and water took place. The site has been subject to several archaeological interventions since the early 20th century. This record is based on a 2003 assessment of all investigations up to that point, as well as a 1982 report on E Greenfield's excavations and previous finds. Early finds from the site include 18th century discoveries of coffins and skeletons with Roman artefacts and a temple was excavated by Greenfield in the 1960s. A large part of the site may have been destroyed during construction of the adjacent Power Station. The temple plan is incomplete, but Greenfield discovered the foundations of a square or rectangular cella surrounded by an area of gravel or pebbles, in which were buried at least two curse tablets. The focus of Iron Age pottery is also this area and the site may have had a ritual focus prior to the Roman period. Many metal finds have also been recovered from the site, some likely votive. An additional stone walled building with a tiled roof, box flues, tesserae and a possible bath house has traditionally been interpreted as a villa, though the possibility of a mansio has recently been suggested.

The site lies in a river valley close to the confluence of the rivers Cole and Blythe with the River Thame. The site is also on a direct line between the early Roman military sites at Mancetter and Metchley, and is equidistant between the two (though there is no known Roman road associated).  The area later occupied by the temple temenos was the site of five round houses (only some contemporaneous, indicating several phases of construction), occupied in the 1st and early 2nd centuries, and abandoned by c. AD 120 to make way for the temple. Artefacts from this phase are suggestive of domestic settlement, and a smithing hearth indicates metal working during this phase. A boundary ditch suggests that the site was at least partially enclosed during this early domestic phase. By the end of the first phase a likely shrine was in existence, possibly contemporary with the latest of the roundhouses, though possibly later, perhaps enclosed by a timber palisade (perhaps an early form of temenos). A large pit was probably ritual. From c. AD 120 a cobbled area sealed many earlier features, and the first recognisable Romano-Celtic temple was constructed, comprising a rectangular timber cella and post pits representing an ambulatory. The principal feature within the cella was a pit, considered ritual in nature, but devoid of finds.  From the later 2nd to early 4th century the timber temple was replaced by a stone cella (after around AD 160), and a semi-circular structure (interpreted as a shrine) was constructed, as well as a square building (possibly another shrine), and the complex was enclosed by a stone wall. Alterations were also made to the stone temple, and it was effectively replaced at some point during this period, perhaps in the 3rd century.  The chronological sequence of the developments in this period is not well understood.  Outside the temple's temenos a bathhouse was also constructed, perhaps constructed at the same time as the first stone temple.  Within the temenos, preceding the square shrine and contemporary with the first stone temple, ovens were discovered, likely to be associated with the ritual preparation of food.  South of the main ritual area there was an area with a continued domestic focus, and a well and buildings with stone foundations were found, as well as further evidence for smithing. A four-post structure was also associated with the late phase of the site, and may have been associated with agricultural activity. This domestic area was further investigated during later evaluation trenching, and was found to continue further south and east than previously suspected.  The temple is likely to have stood until at least c. AD 350 (possibly longer), and there is no evidence for an abrupt end, but rather a gradual decline.",

Pottery and other material date the finds in the cave from the late 1st/early 2ndC AD through to the end of the 4thC AD, though coinage from the second half of the 4thC AD was largely absent. The site is interpreted, with some caution, as a religious site, though some evidence for craft working and production of artefacts is noted from the wide range of materials recovered.

        "Notes": "Excavations as part of the wider programme of archaeological investigations between 1986 and 1995 revealed what is likely to be a late Roman religious complex in a dry valley at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds on the southern side of the Vale of Pickering. The complex comprised at least two masonry structures and associated enclosures and pathways linking a spring to a well-head at the foot of the Wolds. A sub-rectangular structure (15x11.5m) had been cut into the hillside at the back and placed on a man-made terrace. It was constructed from carefully cut chalk blocks, with a rammed chalk floor, and was interpreted as a shrine partly because of its unusual plan-form and construction. A second much larger structure set on a rammed stone platform at the entrance to the main dry valley is suggested as a hostel for visitors to the site, while a second shrine is suggested by an apsidal niche cut into the eastern side of the valley. There could well be further buildings/shrines to the south, though this area was not investigated. As part of the construction of the final (late 4th C AD?) phase of this complex the landscape of the dry valley was heavily remodelled with the creation of large open terraces covered with pebble surfaces.  It is suggested that this had been the site for  seasonal gatherings, and appears to have  been in part maintained or at least respected throughout the life of the adjacent extensive Anglo-Saxon settlement. A range of more ephemeral structures (bread-ovens, possible post-pad structures & pottery kilns; also extensive evidence for metalworking) are thought to have serviced the needs of the population during these gatherings.  It is possible that the shrine complex originated much earlier but resources precluded much investigation of pre-4th C AD levels in that area. Second to fourth century AD pottery was found across the site, which corroborates possible earlier origins for activity. In addition, a single roundhouse contained within a fenced enclosure probably indicates earlier occupation/activity.  The shrine/valley complex lies c 1.5km south of the complex late Iron Age to late/post-Roman ladder settlements, which skirted the fen-edge in the central vale.",

Evidence for mid/late 1st century activity included a high concentration of pottery, heat-cracked stones and charcoal, thought to be representative of domestic settlement.  During the early 2nd century a small rectangular enclosure was constructed, a trackway ran north/south across the area, and a series of enclosures were aligned along the trackway (thought possibly to be for stock). During the mid to late 2nd century to early 3rd century the trackway fell out of use, the focus for activity moved south, and a new fieldsystem was established along the same alignment as the previous enclosures. South of the fieldsystem a circular building was constructed as well as a double-rectangular enclosure (partially overlaying the circular building, so later than it). At this time a T-shaped corndrier was placed approx. 150m to the north of the double-enclosure (possibly within a building, though this is unclear). Two four-post structures (possibly for grain storage) were placed outside and at either end of the double-enclosure. In the early 3rd century a large rectangular three bay, post-built structure was built over the southern end of the double-enclosure, over the area of the roundhouse. At around the same time, approx. 50m to the south, a masonry building (possibly aisled) with wall plaster and a bath suite was constructed.  During the late 3rd-4th century a stone founded rectangular building (interpreted as a cottage-type-house) was placed over the earlier corndrier, and a rectangular post-built building (possibly aisled) was constructed just to the south, whilst a series of rectangular enclosures were created. The bathhouse was demolished in the early 4th century and a fieldsystem was established in its place, whilst pottery from the area of the cottage-house suggests that the buildings lasted to the mid/late 4th century, although coins attest to some activity to the end of the century. There is a suggestion in the report that the cottage-type building may have had a small shrine, based on the distribution of the coins and it is suggested that the coins were votive, and a link between this and fragments of a human skull found in a nearby ditch is speculated.  The buildings from the site are interpreted as lesser dispersed buildings associated with a villa estate, with the suggestion that the main villa building lay outside the excavated areas (possibly represented by a cropmark to the west). The finds assemblage is notable for containing several objects with likely military associations, as well as zoomorphic and a skeuomorphic brooch. The presence of lazy bed gardens are suggested.",

The Roman enclosure has no known parallels though aspects of its plan are comparable to other Romano-British temples and shrines, and has been argued to be a religious enclosure of some type by the excavator (see report). It must be noted here that the range of material and environmental finds, plus the nature of their deposition, is not indicative of a ritual site. It is also not known whether the Bronze Age ring ditch was visible during the Roman period, though the enclosure appears in plan to respect it.  The enclosure comprises two main phases of construction, the first being a square-ditches enclosure, possibly with a timber palisade within. There was also evidence of a post-built entrance to the enclosure.  Later on, this feature was incorporated into the northern end of a larger rectangular enclosure. This feature too, had evidence for a post-built entrance into the main area, perhaps via a causeway. The fill of the ditch of the larger enclosure contained a considerable quantity of oyster shell, animal bone and pottery, particularly on its eastern side (the 'front') of the enclosure.  Outside the enclosures, three pits, one large enough to have been a well. Indeed two adjacent postholes to this feature may have formed a well-head.

Roman pottery (1st to 2nd/3rd C AD) was retrieved from the uppermost fills of both henge ditches along with unidentifiable cremated bone fragments. A four-post structure (2x2.5m) was then built within the footprint of the former eastern henge ditch. A bowl-shaped pit was cut into the NW henge terminal and contained burnt bones from up to two sheep/goats and a neonatal/foetal sheep/goat, along with cereal remains - a possible structured deposit? Radiocarbon dates suggest that the cremation deposit occurred in cal AD 130\u2013260. Another pit nearby contained early Roman pottery and further postholes probably represent the remains of another four-post structure. There are two main suggestions for the Roman activity at this site. Firstly, it could be part of a small settlement including at least one four-post granary and small pits. Alternatively, these features could represent renewed ritual use of the site, with the four-post structure(s) interpreted as having a ritual or funerary use, for example to support excarnated human remains.",

The most obvious sub-rectangular enclosure encompassed at least 0.32ha (full extent not reached) and contained three successive phases of a roundhouse (12.5-15m dia.) defined by ring gullies. The existence of a second conjoined enclosure to the SW at this date is not certain, and it remains possible that the roundhouse contained therein was actually unenclosed at this time. This structure was of two phases (13/16m dia.).  A second main phase of activity (dated very approximately mid-later 1st C AD) is represented by the re-definition and sub-division of existing enclosures (and possibly even the creation of the SW enclosure) into a 'ladder'-type settlement, with five circular structures thought to be contemporary, most contained within different sub-enclosures. The roundhouse entrances varied in orientation. Two superimposed structures  were fundamentally different in that they did not possess an entrance break. The earlier gully (12m dia.) contained large quantities of pottery, including complete vessels in its fills; it was replaced by a smaller (5.5m dia) gully, though this was associated with few artefacts.

Pig remains in the burial grave and cattle bones in the lower fills of the ditch were found to be contemporary with the burial, suggesting a hiatus in activity between the burial and the initial deposition of the cattle during the Roman period, though the monument must have remained visible; no recutting of the ditch was noted.  A nearby square-feature marked by a parallel postholes and beamslot arrangement was thought possibly to have been a shrine, perhaps associated with the burial monument. Dating of this feature was problematic, though it was certainly pre-medieval due to it being cut by ridge and furrow.",

E Fowler suggests a broad date range for the finds from the 1st century BC to the 2nd/3rd century AD, whilst M. Guido suggests glass beads may be of 5th-9th century AD in date. Animal remains include ox, pig, sheep and horse, some with butchery marks. Numerous deer antlers were also present, and some were seemingly associated with the human remains, as well as the remains of at least two Red Deer. No clear stratification was  found, and no trace of any occupation layer, but three distinguishable zones were noticed:  Zone A: Accumulation of human and animal remains of 2nd-9th century AD, possibly washed in from shallow graves and settlements in the vicinity (or ritually deposited?). Zone B: At some time between the 5th and 9th century a large quantity of dog remains in association with those of pig and sheep are suggested as evidence for its use as a dog's den (though, again, a votive function should not be discounted). Zone C: Numerous cast deer antlers were deposited, suggesting the use of the cave as a store (as interpreted in the report, but perhaps also used ritually).  Interpretations of how the material accumulated varies between deliberate deposition and \"wash-in\" from elsewhere (though given the location within the cave and the evidence from other cave sites the former interpretation perhaps seems more likely).",

        "Notes": "The site of an extensive vicus associated with the fort at Maryport, adjacent to the modern coast in the Solway Plain, part of the coastal defence system associated with Hadrian's Wall. The fort has seen a number of interventions, initially by the Senhouse family in the 18th century, then by J Robinson in the late 19th century, subsequently by Collingwood in the 1930s, by Jarrett and Birley in 1966 (1976) and recently by the University of Newcastle and OA North.  Much of the work has focussed on the fort itself though Robinson, the University of Newcastle and OA North have focussed on the vicus. The fort and vicus have also been subject to extensive geophysical survey by Timescape Surveys. The geophysical survey showed the line of the via prinicpalis extending north-east from the NE entrance to the fort with stone strip buildings fronting the road on each side, decreasing in density the further they are from the fort and terminating approx. 350m from the fort. Many buildings were large, and in numerous cases additional small buildings were constructed to the rear of those fronting the road. Back lanes appear to have provided access to the rear of the properties. Individual buildings of note identified during the survey include a substantial probable granary. The size of the larger buildings, at c. 11m in width, are thought almost certainly to have been of aisled construction.  A large prominent building adjacent to the north angle of the fort is regarded as likely to have been of military use and was probably a courtyard building, possibly a mansio. Numerous ditches may represent field boundaries though some may be defensive. Adjacent to the SE field boundary in the field to the NE of the fort, at its highest point, there was a rectangular and a circular building, probably both temples, and two altars were found nearby by Robinson in 1880, along with associated burials and a funeral pyre. The survey shows that this sanctuary site was within an irregular enclosure bounded by a curving ditch and field boundaries. The field to the north-east of this religious sanctuary is the location of the discovery of 17 altars deliberately buried in pits, found in 1870, and this part of the site has been the focus of the most recent work by the University of Newcastle who have retrieved yet more altars. The altars were variously dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Victory and it is inferred that this area of burial was for military as opposed to civilian use. The recent work by The University of Newcastle has indicated that the altars may in fact have been deposited as packing for pits associated with the construction of at least one large hall-type structure (possibly more), possibly of late 4th, or more likely 5th century, date. An apse at the western side of the complex suggests a possible church. This building (or buildings) appears to have been enclosed by a circular ditch. Immediately north east of these timber buildings lay a cemetery, which was separated from the structures by a fence.  This cemetery included stone-lined long-cists and consisted of three north-south and four (later) east-west oriented graves.  One of the earliest of these graves yielded a textile fragment with a calibrated radiocarbon date of AD 240-340 (with 95.4% probability). High magnetic anomalies visible in the geophysical survey results to the north-west of the road suggest a cremation cemetery in an area where a funerary sculpture had previously been found, suggesting burial of the dead along the exit road. The recent work by OA North produced evidence for a stone-built strip building, 20x5m, (possibly a shop) fronting the road, constructed in the early 3rd century AD. This was proceeded by two timber-built strip-buildings, one of which was probably mid-2nd century. The remains of a further two buildings were also recognised. There was evidence that the property boundaries were maintained. A probable well was also identified, as well as possible cisterns.   There is little good evidence for any substantial settlement to the south of the fort and it is suggested that this land may have been retained by the army for pastoral purposes. Iron slag, charcoal and coal discovered by Robinson attest to some industrial activity within the vicus, and finds of slate and nails suggest some tiled roofs. The geophysical survey results suggest that the vicus and its area of farming land may have encompassed an area of approximately 90ha. It is thought that by the end of the 3rd century the vicus would have been a self-sufficient community not reliant on the army. Evidence for early Christianity from the site in the form of tombstones, the orientation of some of the later graves and potentially the late Roman/post Roman church (if it is such).",

Excavation was carried out in the cellars of the Pump Room and recorded much of the inner precinct of the temple. Excavations were also undertaken beneath the modern floor of the Kings's Bath and in the cellars beneath Stall Street and Bath Street. Earlier antiqurian observations are combined in this entry. The Hot Spring/Kings Bath has been entered separately (ID 90052). Much of the Temple has been damaged by past activity. The summary below gives a brief overview of the sequences.Developments in the Hot Spring started in the Neronian or early Flavian period.  A large precinct was constructed to the north and west of the Spring. The precinct was colonaded on the south, west, and north, and had a main entrance in the centre of the east wall. The inner precint was 70 m E-W and 20m N-S. The precinct was paved with limestone slabs. The north and probably south sides has a stylobate. The temple (tetrastyle Corinthian) was situated to the west of the centre with the altar directly to the east. A late neronian or early Flavian date was suggested for the first phase of the temple on architectural grounds.In the Hadrianic period another precinct was built to the east, according to Cunliffe. At the end of the 2nd century/beginning of third century, the sacred spring was enclosed so that it could only be viewed through a door in the precinct. The temple was made larger by the addition of a raised ambulatory, and a new staircase with possible smaller shrines.Around the end of the third century AD, buttresses were constructed against the shrine wall, and a podium added.Further alterations, undated, but thought to be of late 3rd or early 4th century date consisted of additions to the buttresses, reflooring of much of the precinct, and rebuilding of the ambulatory wall.",

The aim was to survey the Roman structures, and remove some archaeological deposits to allow the underpinning of the Pump Room wall to proceed.Much of the Roman sediment and objects had been already removed in 1810 (not recorded) and by Davis in 1879, reported in Cunliffe 1969. New foundations were laid over the King's Bath at that point. Some objected from the 1879 excavations, and those found in the culvert, have been included here. The Hot Spring rose into a funnel. A possible pre-Roman ridge of gravel bordered a length of black peat which ran from the spring to the river. In the late Neronian/early Flavian period a masonry polygonal reservoir was constructed around the spring, and the water was canalised in a vaulted drain. The reservoir was lined with lead sheets and mortar. At the end of the second century, a vaulted chamber was constructed over the spring, the reservoir was raised by a metre, and 4 rectangular pedestals were constructed around the reservoir. After the Roman period, the vaulted roof collapse in to the spring sealing the votive deposit.The southern part of the spring was excavated to 1.4m below the tile surround, around 100-200mm deposit was removed aound the periphery, and 40 sq m in the centre was excavated 1.4m deep. The reservoir was filled with 3 distinct layers - at the bottom sand containing votives, overlain by the remains of the collapsed vault, and then collapsed masonry.The entire sand deposit was sieved to 5mm. Much of the ritual deposit was left intact.",

An area south of Bath Street (the Beau Street Excavations) has been included within the New Bath Spa entry (ID 90027). A strip of stratified archaeological deposit in the centre of the area was excavated very hastily, whilst observations were made in other areas.Three main phases of Roman activity were recorded. Phase 1 consisted of a NE-SW gravel-surfaced road, constructed from solid limestone rubble foundations and rubble kerbing. In the east of the excavation, the western portico walls of the Outer Temple Precinct were recorded, and this road ran through the NW corner. A gravelled surface was recorded near to the Temple Precinct. Although stratigraphic observations were tricky, this road was interpreted as pre-dating the portico. Two gullies were recorded, running N-S parallel to the later portico. Limited dating evidence was available, but road laying was dated to c. AD 60-70.Phase 2 activity consisted of a further road, which antiquarian observations showed skirted the NW of the Temple Precinct. It was constructed of gravel. The southern half of the western temple portico, and a small part of the southern portico, lay at the eastern end of the excavation area.  In some areas the walls had survived to 1m high. No floor surfaces were recovered. Footings and a short part of dwarf wall were surviving evidence of the stylobate. Important information was recovered concerning the Temple Outer Precinct. The foundation of the stylobate were cut in to a layer of clay and buried soil, showing that portico construction was not in the first phase of Roman activity. The gravel courtyard surface of the Temple was 0.7m below the stylobate top, and so not directly accessible from the portico. Later, an op sig floor was laid over the gravel courtyard surfaces, potentially part of a Late Roman high status house. Dating evidence for this phase was quite limited. The portico was constructed in the mid 2nd century.In phase 3, several buildings were recorded. Building A, in the east of the excavation area, was composed of 2 masonry walkways, probably lying over the road. To the west, Building B lay over the roads, built in the later 2nd century. Rubble foundations and robber trenches, no surviving walls. There was very limited evidence for floors. Finds suggested domestic occupation, and window glass and stuctural stone suggested a reasonable status building. A  road, N-S alligned, to the west of these buildigns was recorded. At the west of the site, Building C was recorded in modern day cellars. A multi-roomed masonry structure, 1m wide footings, mortared rubble, potentially had a hypocaust. Mid 4th century construction date. Building D, in the south-west of the area, was explored in a few small excavations. It has an apse (diameter 4.3m), N-S room of 5.6m x 3m, and further rooms probably to the S and W. No floors survived. Painted wall-plaster was found in a  robber trench. This building post-dates AD350.At the east of the excavation, the Temple Precinct Portico was partly demolished.",

A total of 29 sites have been excavated, all reported together here. The settlement saw major phases of occupation, mainly Late Iron Age settlement, Early Roman fort, ditches and streets, extensive C2nd occupation and ritual activity and C4th defences and further domestic buildings.An extensive Iron Age settlement was present, recognised by a series of ditches and pits. Ceramics indicate occupation began in the late 1st century BC. Five enclosures were excavated, containing hearths, walls and gateways, indicating domestic dwellings. Occupation was focussed on the south side of the hill. From AD43, the settlement was reorganised. A series of Claudian ditches were dug, v and u shaped, 1.5-2m wide, interpreted as enclosures. Within one enclosure, the location of a fort was suggested c. AD70. A 3.6m wide, 1.5m deep v-shaped ditch running nnw-sse, with Flavian sherds in the lowest fills. Very few features were recorded in the interior, but much of the first century AD surface had been destroyed by later levelling.  A cobbled yard was recorded to the north, at least 18m2 in size. A large hearth was recorded, with in situ cooking vessels, one containing hare bones, one containing fresh water mussels, suggesting cooking was abandoned. To the NE, a potential latrine pit, a gully and rubbish pits were recorded. Contemporary features were a well and 2 iron-smelting furnaces. One was 1 1.2m in size and associated with a large lump of iron slag. The other furance was 2m in diameter.  In the s-w of the area, a house, 4 timber-lined wells, boundary ditches and pits were recorded. The timber house was 3.7+m long, with a straight ditch.  2 first century iron smetling furnaces.Construction of a SW-NE road (Akeman St), and a SE-NW road (Via Devana). Akeman St was constructed from cobbles laid on marl and gravel, it was 11m wide, cambered,with a ditch on either side. Only fragments of the Via Devana could be recorded, including the road side ditch.Early C2nd AD, the ''fort'' was levelled, and the pits and ditches within the Iron Age settlement were backfilled. The construction of a large masonry building with a hypocaust (possible mansio), other large buildings. Other timber, wattle and daub buildings were built, with single rooms, fenced/ditched gardens and gravelled yards (up to 12m long).  A total of 16 houses were recorded, plus a possible mansio. The buildings were 3-6m long with plastered and painted interior walls. Some had cement floors and internal fire places.  The yards contained querns, wells, ovens and hearths. Also pits and timber lined wells. The mansio was constructed from limestone (mostly robbed), 1.2m thick wall, and had a hypocaust. Large amounts of painted plaster were recovered. Only a small part could be excavated.A further substantial building was located at the corner of the Via Devana and Akeman Street. A timber-lined cellar contained a cement floor, and was filled with lots of distintegrated timber and plaster, many tegulae, painted plaster. The building had evidently burnt down.Major ritual focus in the C2nd and C3rd AD at the southern side of the hill. Large subterranean ceremonial site/shrine, 8.2 x 4m in size, rectangular with a  semi-circular southern end, and a niche cut into the chalk 1.5m above floor level. There was a gravel floor with a post setting. Eight postholes were recorded in the NE area and interpreted as supports for a staircase. Several animal burials were recorded in the underlying chalk, included an adult dog, a cow skull. Overlain by layers of charcoal, burnt clay and ash, and then a horse skeleton (with its head split open), surrounded by  whole vessels, a miniature flagon, a huge samian bowl\u2026 3 small adult dogs were laid  in a triangle to the NE. Also an articulate cow, with a sheep between its legs, half a of large dog. These animal burials were overlain by  pottery, glass vessels, gaming pieces, a bone flute and various  household objects. Also 13 deep ritual shafts contained infant burials and dogs. Each fully excavated one contained a mature dog 5-7yo, a rush mat, a wicker basket with the stain of an infant burial. Five shafts contained small shoes. One shaft contained a small wooden coffin with an infant burial inside. Other shafts contained falcon, horse , sheep, cattle, pig, chicken/pheasent and cat. A timber-framed petangonal shrine was recorded to the east of these ritual pits, measuring 3m in diameter.Other nearby pits contained horse and dog bones, complete pots and an articulated falcon. One pit contained a horse skeleton (mainly decayed), wood ash, 3 colour coated beakers, decayed planks, and a circular wooden object. Other activity seems to be at a lower scale in the C3rd AD. The houses and yards were thought to be out of use. The streets continued to be used as were several houses. Several pits were interpreted as quarries, at least 4 wells were recorded. At the beginning of the 4th century a 12m wide ditch, a 2-3m wide limestone wall and 10m wide internal rampart was recorded enclosing 8.6ha.  Parts of the NE and E defences were excavated, and previous observations confirm the remaining line. Three dates were excavated at the south, east and north. Wooden structures were built, and rubbish pits and latrines. Around 5 new houses were recorded. Two pottery kilns were located within the n-w of the walled area. 1 Late Roman burial, young man, almost prone, no feet.There was no evidence for C5th destruction, but black earth build ups were observed in some areas, and no definite evidence for C5th occupation was observed.",

Excavation was undertaken at 29-31 Rochford Road (D), 1-8 Rochford Road (K), The Chase (L), Goldlay Road (P), Baddow & Golday Rds junction (Q), 1-12 Goldlay Road (AB), Baddow Road (AS), Midmay Road (CF1).The earliest features recorded at sites D and K were large hollows, probably brickearth quarry pits, backfilled with mid C1st pottery. Several ovens were dated to the end of the C1st, and masory footings for probable timber buildings. Two ditched enclosures were on an E-W alignment. One was c. AD60-80 and associated with C1st votive deposits around a 'totem' post. The votive pit around the post contained an oil lamp, brooches, jewellery and coins. Hollows were interpeted as a \"grubbed-out group of trees ?sacred grove\". The enclosures had a 19.5m entranceway in the NE, and  was  72m E-W. A further enclosure to the SE was evidenced by its NE corner with a 1.5m entrance way. The second enclosure was dug in the early 2nd and backfilled in the mid 2nd century.A C1st AD shrine was constructed at site K, interpreted as a 2-celled structure with external square buttress and apse. The building was directly to the S of the earlier ditched enclosure. A corridor structure was constructed in the 2nd century, consisting of parallel E-W slots, for a hedge or sleeper beams. A series of charcoal filled pits were closely followed by storage-jar hearths. A ritual nature for these was suggested given the previous and subsequent phases. Possible structures were evidenced by postholes and paving levels at the eastern and southern edges of the corridors. Overall little evidence for C3rd activity was recoverd.A roughly E-W road ran to the S of the main temple site, constructed c AD90-150.A fourth century octagonal Romano Celtic Temple was evidenced by robbing trenches and a few pieces of masonry. The levelling deposits below the temple contained tile rubble, stone, mortar and painted plaster, perhaps indicating a previous temple in the vicinity. The building was 17.7m in length, with a 11m cella, walls c1m thick. Plan of the ambulatory walls was much disturbed and floor levels had been totally damaged.To the S of the temple, there was evidence for building foundations fronting the road, with rubbish pits and ovens. Many coins were found, interpreted as showing close links to the temple. Later Roman activity is unclear. Late Roman finds were mostly recovered from medieval layers and the Roman levels were eroded by this later activity. A posthole structure within the NE of the ambulatory had no pottery to date it, but was suggested as being of C5th date.",

        "Notes": "Small-scale excavation within the Roman walled town undertaken to assesses the impact of modern grazing activity on the archaeological deposits. Trench A was located at the centre of the town at the site of the temple, and site B in the NE. At the temple site, excavation was largely constrained to recovering the plan of the Romano-Celtic temple structure revealed by antiquarian excavations. The temple consisted of a small square walled cella, enclosed by an ambulatory structure. The cella was 3.5m N-S and 3.3m E-W. Walls were 0.6m thick. The ambulatory had an internal length of 10m, constructed of limestone. Small interventions were made within the cella, one uncovering an ashy layer with pottery and bone. A metalled area was recorded to the south of the temple consistig of crushed limestone, with embedded pottery, tile and oyster shell. A sub-rectangular mortar area was suggested as a bedding layer for a statue. An early and later precinct wall was recorded at the southern side of the courtyard.Another masonry building was recorded 1m W of the temple building, stone foundations, 0.6m wide wall. Mortar, tiles, op sig wer recovered in the areas. Several small pits and postholes were recorded. At the southern edge of site A, a metalled road surface E-W was recorded.A geophysical survey had identified a circular structure to the east. The extensive survey, using a magnetometer and geoprospection, also showed a large square ditched enclosure in the SW (?Iron Age), a dendritic street network with side streets, masonry buildings, both single celled and 2/3 room strip buildings, and a large building complex (?mansio).Area B in th NE recorded the defences. A NW-SE ditch, 0.6m wide, 0.2m deep, contained pottery bone charcoal. The ditch was overlain by 1  possible masonry structure, a limestone spread (2.5 x 2.2m) with possible internal floor layers and hearth. This structure was then cut by the towns defences. A line of W-E postholes was recorded. A later stone wall, 0.7m wide, with an occupation layer on the N side. The northern area of the trench was covered with a rubble spread, 8m wide, 0.2m thick. This was suggested as the robbed out remains of the defensive wall. No dating evidence was retrieved.",

        "Notes": "The site of a vicus associated with the fort at Caersws, Powys, in the Severn Valley, approximately 250m north of the Severn. A number of development-led excavations and watching briefs have taken place within the area of the vicus since the 1960s, and it is considered to be one of the best understood vici from the region. See database record 45020 for a full summary of the site. This record includes data from several investigations between 1984 and 1993, totalling c. 744m2, to the east of the fort, which produced evidence for a defensive ditch and a sequence of at least four/five timber buildings and two ovens. Whilst an early ditch produced samian of c. AD 70-110, finds associated with the sequence of buildings suggested that the principal activity began in the mid 2nd century and continued into the 3rd century. One of the buildings was square and apparently enclosed by a palisade, and this building was interpreted as a potential Romano-Celtic temple (the enclosure perhaps a temenos). A fragment of a statuette of Venus was recovered from a rubbish pit immediately to the north of this building. Many features were unphased, including various pits and postholes. One shallow elongated pit contained no artefacts but thought possibly to be an inhumation grave. Other features in this part of the vicus produced included up to 4 wells and pits and postholes and gullies, some probably structural.",

        "Notes": "Located on a low promontory southern Anglesey, close to a bridging point of the River Cefni, lies a multi-period site which produced prehistoric funerary activity and an early medieval cemetery. The Roman phase consisted of a small, square masonry structure. The excavation report suggests that the structure was associated with 1st-2ndC AD casting of small decorative bronzes. The square building was partly built over a large pit which was filled with similar material that seen in the foundation of the structure, and though undated, probably directly preceded its construction. The pit appeared to have a central socket at its base, suggesting the presence of a post or similar. The cut of the pit feature was also quite regular and suggests that it was not merely a quarry pit. The features of the site were all enclosed by a circular metalled bank, within which the stone structure was centrally placed. The stone lining lay directly on top of a Bronze Age cairn. A copper alloy pendant of early Roman date lay in the stone build up. The site also produced samian ware, but little evidence for domestic occupation could be discerned. The industrial activity appeared to be light in intensity and, considering the landscape location, the site is probably best interpreted as a shrine.",
