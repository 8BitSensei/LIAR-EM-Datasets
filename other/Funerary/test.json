The south-western settlement originated in the early Iron Age and during the Roman period comprised two groups of conjoined rectangular enclosures either side of the trackway, over an area exceeding 1ha. Features comprised at least one post-built building along with four waterholes and a timber-lined well. A total of 71 inhumation burials were recorded, mostly within three enclosed cemeteries. The NE settlement comprised a 'ladder-style' enclosure system (enclosures c 40m sq), c 1ha in extent, established along an early Iron Age boundary (though no evidence for later Iron Age activity here). The absence of many features except waterholes suggests most of these enclosures were used for stock, though one did contained a post-built building. A small number of inhumation burials lay to the rear of these enclosures. A double ditched rectangular enclosure lay to the rear of the ladder enclosure system, in the centre of a large open space. The outer ditches were 30x27m across and inner were 19x16m, with an off centre entrance in the SE of the outer enclosure. No internal features but a small amount of later Roman pottery and 3 late Roman coins. Its purpose it unknown though a similar double ditched enclosure 7km to the north (not excavated) was associated with religious material and interpreted as a shrine. No specialist reports as yet except some further details on the burials.",

A two-phased evaluation of the site in 1993 revealed at least 12 inhumation burials within an area of Roman ditches with pottery dating from the 1st to 4thC AD. It is unknown whether these ditches formed a purpose-made enclosure for the burials or whether they were associated with a nearby settlement, as the excavation failed to reveal whether they fully enclosed the funerary area. These findings added to excavations carried out in 1966-8 which discovered three further inhumation just to the north of the main site along with a continuation of some of the associated ditches.  All features were overlain by a homogeneous plough-soil containing Roman medieval and post-medieval pottery. It also contained disarticulated human bone and there was clear evidence of truncation of both graves, ditches and natural features.  The dating of the burials is remains dubious, since the graves were not fully excavated. However, the orientation of the inhumations, their association with a ditch containing clearly dateable Roman material, and the presence of iron coffin nails point towards a later Roman provenance. A N-S orientation of the graves suggests they were associated with the ditches, which were also N-S aligned.",

The earliest evidence for occupation took the form of a building in the north-east of the site. The excavator argues that this structure may have had a military function. The structure was represented by beamslots, postholes and an oven, though no obviously military artefacts were present. A quarry pit was also excavated close by the building, presumably for brickearth extraction, though possibly for gravel; the author does not state which.  Later Roman construction and a burial was also present in the same area. To the north of the present church was a group of burials, one within a limestone sarcophagus, dated to the early to mid 5thC AD (see burial data for details). These may suggest the presence of a religious building or monument in the vicinity.  To the south of the church a late Roman tile kiln was excavated whose final firing was dated by archaeomagnetometry to between AD400 and 450. The kiln produced both tile and brick, and it was unusual in that it had a double flue. The excavator states that this made it the latest Roman structure found in London.  Evidence for Saxon activity was not encountered until 7thC AD burials were unearthed.",

See also site ID 9021 for other parts of the roadside settlement. The main temple complex just south of Watling St, was focused around one and then two substantial Romano-Celtic type temples, and incorporated many additional sub-foci, such as altars, columns and smaller temples/shrines, one of which formed an elaborate entranceway into the walled temenos. Dating evidence suggests late 1st to early/mid 4thC AD, though later 4thC deposits suggest continued sanctity. The area termed the 'sanctuary complex' lay c 100m further NE, around the springs. Earliest activity here was represented by a late Iron Age enclosure and 'processional way' leading from the river up on the slopes overlooking the springs. In the mid-later 1stC AD, 3 successive and enigmatic circular structures near the springs may have been shrines and/or bakeries. During the mid 2ndC, this area was transformed into a religious building complex, focused upon the springs and enclosed by a ditch. At its centre was a rectangular masonry footed temple (15x5m), with at least two other buildings and a ritual shaft. Many votive deposits recovered from the river bed. Most activity within the Sanctuary was confined to the mid-later 2ndC (including many infant burials), though some activity remained into the 4th C AD.  Overall, the site is possibly the largest and most important religious centre yet known in Roman Britain.",

The site at East Hill lies on the crest of a slope overlooking the Darenth Valley just to the West.  The site of the burial ground first discovered in 1792 and 1797 in East Hill field when workmen dug up 2 large stone coffins containing skeletons. Both coffins were destroyed. In 1804 a workman dug up skeletons laid north to south buried side by side in wooden coffins. Pottery and iron fragments were found among the bones. Several cremation pits containing pottery were also found.  J.V. Ritson carried out a small excavation in 1965 (just west of the site) revealing 35 graves, amongst which were a number furnished with pottery vessels of 3rd\u00134th century date. The finds are in Dartford Museum and the site is now under rough pasture.  In 1974, excavation was carried out on a neighbouring area by DDAG and continued until 1988 when Canterbury Archaeological Trust took over revealing 186 graves, of which 83 were fully excavated.  More recently, excavations carried out by Wessex Archaeology uncovering 109 further graves. The latest phase of excavation clearly defined the cemetery's easterly extent, while its northern and southern limits remain untested. The general absence of cremation burials from the East Hill cemetery suggests it was later Romano-British in date, perhaps of the late 2nd century continuing into the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. This corresponds with the date of the grave goods recorded by Ritson, and with the limited suite of Roman pottery from the 2006 excavation.",

The report from the 1962 work was subsequently published and re-discussed in Archaeologia Cantiana in 2005.  Unfortunately, exact details of the 1901 discovery could not be recorded since the remains were soon destroyed by works, but Woodruff considered there to have been 11 or 12 cremations in two discreet clusters. Southern, on the other hand, was able to record a total of 11 burials, though no surviving plans of exact locations exist (though they may now be under the present Lord Warden Avenue).  Modern analysis of the pottery suggests that the majority of the burials date to the 2nd C, with a few possibly falling either side.",

        "Notes": "Extensive excavations in the clay Vale of Aylesbury revealed elements of a settlement(s) dating from the middle Iron Age to the later Roman period, exposed in two open area excavation trenches (Areas 1 and 2), 100m apart. Middle Iron Age activity was sparse (in contrast to the excavated areas 6 & 8 at Brooklands to the east), though the later Iron Age (c 50 BC \u0013 AD 10) saw significant increase in occupation density, with elements of a farmstead revealed across both areas, comprising ditched rectilinear enclosures, 6 roundhouses (defined by gullies, one within one of the enclosures), two four-post structures, other post-built structures, a cremation burial and various pit groups, gullies and linear ditches. A related fieldsystem was located to the east and NE, and overall the site appears to have been an extensive unenclosed settlement. There were substantial changes during the very late Iron Age/early Roman period (c AD 10-80), with a shift in occupation to the east (within Area 1), where a substantial complex settlement was established, bounded by trackways and ditches and internally sub-divided into different activity areas (domestic/craft  and burial). At the centre of the site was a large roundhouse, with its own complex of adjacent enclosures, one of which contained a pottery kiln. Three smaller roundhouses lay to the north. The southern part of the site was used for cremation burial enclosures, with outlying burials to the west. Within Area 2 to the south, another separate farmstead was suggested of this date, comprising enclosures, trackways, fencelines and pits. Few archaeological features were found between the two settlement areas. A shield boss may have been a deliberate deposit in the southern farmstead. The Area 1 and Area 2 settlements continued in use into the early Roman period, with ad hoc additions, though the roundhouses gradually fell out of use in the later 1st/early 2nd C AD.  The burial area was enhanced at this time and included a 'ritual pit' and a pentagonal enclosure, within which was a posthole structure and a small enclosure surrounding a mid 2nd C AD cremation burial. This was interpreted as a shrine, though seems to have been a mortuary monument. The middle Roman period (c AD 150-300) saw an apparent reduction in settlement and population size and the Area 1 farmstead was substantially re-planned at this time. The new elements included a masonry-footed building (15x7m), along with a stone-lined well, waterholes, an oven (simple corn-drying oven?) and a new enclosure system (interpreted as for livestock). Field ditches lay to the north, and the burial area continued to function in the SW part of the site (an inhumation burial lay adjacent to a horse burial). The settlement in Area 1 continued to be modified into the later Roman period (AD 300-410), with the fragmentary remains of a new masonry footed building (in area of the old building; 17x13m), and two other timber buildings, one of which is suggested as a granary, the other defined by post-pads. A metalled pathway also observed. Use of the cemetery continued, with an inhumation burial lying close to a waterhole which is suggested to have had a ritual function. Elsewhere, the presence of waterholes suggested an increase in pastoral farming, though a stone-built Y-shaped corndrier lay within an enclosure just to the north of the main settlement. The site was entirely abandoned at the end of the Roman period.",

The character of the settlement, which ranged from the late Iron Age to the early post-Roman period in date, was difficult to discern in the limited area of excavation.  Activity emerged in the late Iron Age, after a hiatus, in the form of considerable of iron-working evidence including iron slag, oven and furnace linings and lesser quantities of bronze working slag, together with small assemblages of Later Iron Age pottery. No evidence for structures or rubbish pits could be related to this period.  The early Roman activity appears to continue from the late Iron Age, though a new double ring ditch enclosure seems to have been constructed on the site, as evidenced by the excavation of its entrance. 1stC AD Alice Holt wares positively dated the construction of the feature, which also became a burial site with two 1stC AD cremations inserted in and around the enclosure. Timber-post, gravel-floored structures were built and utilised across the 2nd/3rdC AD, indicating continued occupation.  The site became susceptible to flooding in the early 4thC AD, though during the late 4th-early 5thC AD the area was again used as a burial ground. Two inhumations were found to align on approximate east to west orientations and, though no human bone had survived, grave goods were recovered including a Chi-Rho-inscribed finger ring. One of the burials also appeared to be covered by a small superstructure indicated by four surrounding postholes.  It is possible that the continued burial at the ring ditch enclosure signified its ritual importance, possibly as a shrine, though this is not intimated by the excavators.",

Also identified were burials of Anglo-Saxon date and a probable Bronze Age ring ditch.  The late Iron Age religious site is, so far, unique in Britain both in its extent and range of associated features. Being almost entirely excavated it included at least two but probably four roughly square shrines, a number of pyre sites, and 161 cremation burials. Clear spatial organisation could be discerned, with the burials being arranged around a circular space, with a smaller group placed due SE of the main cluster. The pyre sites ranged in form from X, Y and T-shaped features, whilst postholes in the circular area may have been for structures used in the mortuary practices. One grave located close to the shrines had been marked by a funerary monument. Artefacts suggest a broad date range for the Iron Age cemetery of 100-40BC.  Just over 100 years after the Iron Age cemetery had stopped being used for burial, the site became used for Romano-British cremations. The Roman cemetery lie to the SE of its Iron Age predecessor and, although it was situated adjacent, it did not disturb any part of it. This suggests that the Iron Age cemetery may have remained visible and in memory to the Romano-British population. Whilst smaller than the Iron Age cemetery, the Romano-British burials surrounded a purpose built ring ditch (separate to the Bronze Age feature) in similar fashion to the Iron Age circular space. Only pyre site was identified and of the 36 burials the majority were urned (in contrast to the Iron Age burials, which were mostly unurned). A preference for depositing the urn in the north of the grave was noted.",

The site was first noted by the discovery of a substantially-built masonry structure, interpreted by excavators from the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society as a Roman military watchtower. However, subsequent reanalysis of the site archive by MoLAS has put this interpretation in serious doubt (see also Site ID 8031).  The earliest evidence of activity at the site includes late 1st/early 2nd C AD brickearth quarrying and cremation burials. The construction of the 'tower' is difficult to date, but may also belong to the earliest phase and was perhaps a focus for the early burials. It is possible that the 'tower' was originally constructed as a cella or a shrine, and is perhaps a mausoleum. The mausoleum remained standing until at least the mid-4th C AD.  The early phase was replaced by a re-organisation in land-use through the construction of a post-built structure and associated gullies in the 3rd C AD. A large boundary was placed just south of the mausoleum and a fenceline was evidently built in front of that. The ditch was also picked up in later excavations to the west and was seen to separate the mausoleum to the north and a bath-house to the south (see Site ID 8031). The two areas now seem likely to form part of a wider roadside/nucleated settlement.  A number of large pits were dug in the eastern area of the site. Cattle remains represented a primary component of some of these pits, particularly from head and foot elements. It is suggested that these represent primary butchery of carcasses, perhaps destined for markets in Londinium, or the waste material from tanning activities.  By the late 3rd C AD, a large timber-built 'barn' (perhaps a workshop of some type), with an associated drain, and a smaller wattle structure were built to the east of the mausoleum. A number of smaller ditches and gullies later truncated the timber building, found to contain cattle remains with a similar signature to the earlier pits. These features dated from the late 3rd/early 4th C AD.  The mid-4th C AD saw a period of intensified industrial use with features which seem to indicate a complete change from the land use and divisions which preceded it. Timber-lined tanks with associated drains and metalled surfaces were constructed in an open area. The drainage gullies suggested that an industrial activity involving liquids, such as tanning, was in use with these features. Leather underwear and the sole from a shoe were found in the backfill of one of the tanks. However, it is now known that the tanks and gullies were probably constructed to supply an adjacent Roman bath-house, coinciding with refurbishments to the latter.  By the late 4th C AD, the large masonry tower had certainly been demolished, though perhaps slightly earlier, and the industrial features seen from the mid-4th C AD had been covered by a layer of masonry rubble which included box-flue, roof tile and opus signinum, indicating that a substantial domestic building had probably lain in the vicinity, perhaps associated with the earlier structures. Late Roman inhumation burials were then found to have been dug into this layer, indicating that the site had returned to being used as a cemetery. A thick dark silt layer then covered this final phase of Roman occupation.",

The early Roman enclosure dates c.AD50-150 and was positioned on the edge of a promontory of high land, sloping downwards to the east through which the road ran. The road then turned south, presumably to link the site with the main London to Colchester road running south of the site. The remains of the two flint-based buildings were identified; quantities of roof-tile were recovered nearby, whilst tesserae and box-flue tiles from a hypocaust were also recovered from the plough soil in the area. A metalled courtyard was noted to have served the area between the buildings and the road. Together, these features have been interpreted as a religious complex (a temenos).  To the south of the enclosure, close to an early Bronze Age burial mound, was at least one LIA/ERB cremation burial placed within the associated enclosure-system. These ditches, indicative of a field-system, contained numerous LIA/ERB burials, quantities of imported LIA/ERB pottery, and focused on an early Bronze Age barrow (though, according to the excavator, this is possibly Roman too).  Most of the Roman features are dated to the early and middle Roman period with no continuity visible into the early medieval period visible in the archaeological record.",

Excavation revealed almost the entire plan of a Roman-period cemetery which developed alongside a road that took inhabitants, pilgrims and other traffic into the town. A total of 558 graves or other funerary-related features were encountered. Such features include bustum, cenotaphs, urned cremations, unurned cremations, inhumations, and pyre sites.  A bustum is a pyre site that also functioned as a place of burial. The pyre burns down into a deep under-pyre pit and the remains are buried in situ. Busta are comparatively rare in Britain, and are perceived as an intrusive rite introduced from the Continent (Philpott 1991, 48). They appear to have originated in Gaul, but are found widely distributed along the German frontier, as far to the east as Pannonia (or modern Hungary). A large proportion of busta are found in cemeteries associated with Roman military installations in the north (e.g. High Rochester, Derby Racecourse; Beckfoot; Herd Hill, Cardurnock).  The cemetery was located at a site previously used for burial in the middle Iron Age. At least one grave belonged to that time. No burials were certainly made during the late Iron Age, though quarry pits and a boundary ditch record activity dating before the Roman conquest. The site received the greatest number of burials, both inhumation and cremation, during the early Roman period (AD 43-130). The rate of burial declined during the 2nd century and, by the 3rd century, few graves were dug.  The latest burials comprise a group of five dating after AD 260; given the fortunes of the neighbouring town, none is likely to date far into the 4th century. The site was abandoned after the Roman period until medieval times when quarrying and agricultural activity began.",

Early to middle Iron Age agricultural and funerary activity is attested to have developed from Neolithic and Bronze Age occupation, though no settlement evidence from this phase was discovered.  Early Romano-British activity began in the 1stC AD, but was associated with trackways in use during and continuing from the Iron Age. Domestic finds abounded at the western end of the excavation, mainly near a sunken trackway and in pits and field-enclosures to either side of it. Whilst no domestic focus was obvious, the quantity and range of finds, and the presence of two small cemeteries, strongly suggest a small rural settlement lay close-by. The larger of the two enclosures was constructed at the intersection of a large holloway and a double-ditched trackway. This was used as a cremation cemetery c.AD40-55. Yet, whilst no evidence for structures were found, the enclosure appears to have been maintained and relatively long-lived. The presence of Bronze Age barrows at the site may have been significant with regards to the siting of the RB cemeteries.  A number of pits in the area dating to the late Roman period attest to continued occupation. Fish remains were unusually abundant in some of these features, and fishing weights were also found.  That this settlement waned after the mid-late 3rd century is inferred from a greatly reduced suite of remains, and from progressive infilling of the sunken trackway. Limited occupation, or at least occasional use of the site, is likely to have continued into the later 4th century. A possible corn-drying oven was excavated in the late Roman settlement.  Early Anglo-Saxon evidence from Saltwood Tunnel is dominated by three separate inhumation cemeteries, each located in the vicinity of a Bronze Age barrow.",

The site is situated on the Mill Hill ridge overlooking the sea to the east. The site was discovered by earlier quarrying at the site, which may have destroyed other parts of the cemeteries, but had produced evidence of Iron Age and Roman burials as well as a range of contemporary brooches and complete pots. A number of earlier finds were reanalysed for the latest report on the site (Parfitt 1995).  Over 500 archaeological features were revealed including 132 burials, of which the majority were inhumations, and over half dated to the 6th C AD. 42 inhumations, however, along with 5 pre-Roman cremations and a horse burial, were found to be Iron Age in date. One burial, called the 'warrior burial', was placed in isolation from the main cemetery group and furnished with a range of items, such as a bronze headband, iron sword and bronze scabbard, suggesting an individual of high-status. The site also included several four- and six-poster structures, suspected of being funerary monuments, whilst a 2.5m deep shaft located between the two main cemeteries gave access to an underground chamber, possibly a shrine. This feature was filled in by the 2nd C AD and contained, amongst other items, a small carved chalk figurine.  Domestic activity appeared to be minimal, if mostly absent, though material from associated pits indicate that Iron Age occupation occurred through the early, middle and late phases. The earliest inhumation on site gave a radiocarbon date of between the 8th and 4thC BC, though previous excavations had produced Bronze Age cremations from the barrow. However, a significant break in the occupation sequence was evident between the construction of the barrow and the Iron Age cemeteries.  The burial ground was not used during the late Roman period (with two marginally possible exceptions).",

No specific dating is given for the burials and no pottery or finds analysis has been undertaken.  The work by OA (2007) revealed widely dispersed activity (possibly brought about by the nature of the evaluation) consisting of 3 2ndC AD cremations which were probably part of larger burial groups. Late Roman evidence is concentrated in the west of the site where a midden deposit was located in low-lying marshland. The midden consisted of an extensive, organic, pottery-rich deposit, interpreted as a saltern by the excavator, though called a 'midden' due to lack of material evidence for the former.

No funds were available for post-excavation analysis and the human bone report is said to be being readied for publication elsewhere by English Heritage.  Several clusters of burial could be discerned from the plan. Notably, whilst most of the burials were variably N-S aligned, three broadly E-W aligned and none included grave goods, apart form one which included a jar with a burnished Chi-Rho monogram on the base.",

The subsequent building phase (mid/late 2nd C AD) began with the construction of a well-built circular shrine on top of a raised knoll by the river and associated rectangular building. The main part of the settlement was laid out from this point onwards, with particular emphasis on the 3rd C AD. Over 30 stone-foundationed rectangular buildings were constructed from the 2nd to 4th C AD, with interlinking gravelled streets, mainly on the west side of the Fosse Way. The buildings included subsidiary shrines, a possible courtyard guesthouse by the road and the possible remains of a water mill 100m to the east of the road alongside the Broadmead Brook. In the early 3rd C a substantial octagonal podium was built around the shrine and the river was partly canalised. The burning of the circular temple occurred soon after, and it was replaced by an elaborate octagonal temple. There is evidence for a decline in the temple during the later 4th C AD, and many of the buildings now appears associated with metalworking, including bronzeworking, iron smelting and manufacture of pewter. Occupation of sorts continued until at least the end of the 4th C AD.",

Around this time, an early 1stC AD inhumation and a nearby deep shaft were dug close to the presumed late Iron Age settlement. The shaft included organic deposits at its bottom, though remained open probably until the 4thC AD.  The site appears to have developed into the Roman period with the centre of the settlement likely lying to the north of the excavated area, where rubble surface spreads were identified alongside geophysical survey of a ditched complex. Dating is unclear due to Victorian excavations, but an isled hall and a large southern enclosure leading from the hall were exposed and may originate in the 2nd/early 3rdC AD. The structural detail of the building paralleled that at Houghton Down. Evidence suggests that it began as a domestic dwelling, perhaps serving a larger villa settlement to the north, though the building developed in the second half of the 4thC AD with three rooms added to one end, with corndrier and ovens added to the main room and one of the three compartments used as a smithy.  About this time a fenced enclosure was constructed between the hall and the southern enclosure ditch, encompassing the early grave and the ritual shaft which may have still been open to some level. In the top layer of the shaft the bone of a purported aurochs was recovered. It was argued that the grave was still known about and the area was a 'sanctuary'.  In this final phase, the aisled hall was largely demolished apart from the smithy room which became reused and floored with a highly elaborate mosaic (now in the British Museum, the mosaic had a Victorian cover building placed over it - now displaced). The room and enclosed area are argued to have been used as a shrine, with the room being utilised as a dining room for special occasions and feasting. 5-7 late 4th/early 5thC AD inhumations were then dug through the foundations of the hall on the opposite side of the 'dining room' to the sanctuary area, representing a probable sub-Roman cemetery. Chaff-tempered sherds and a spearhead were recovered from the area.",

In early 2nd C, major reorganisation with extensive rectangular enclosures (ditched and fenced) forming components of a planned complex, with outer fields and trackways. One enclosure contained two large aisled buildings (18.5x11.5m; 17x11m; one domestic, other agricultural), lined wells and entrance gateway. Also, a potential shrine defined by enclosures and an industrial/working area. Many internal developments, with significant changes in later 3rd/4th C, leading to demolition of two buildings and construction of what has been termed a modest 'cottage style' villa with associated heated room. Here it is interpreted as a farmstead, especially as the heated room (south of the main building) may well have been a smokehouse. The building was surrounded by a substantial outer enclosure comprising ditch and wall. A circular masonry shrine lay to the east and a small cemetery to the west. Occupation at least up until end of 4th C AD. Two corndriers (T-shaped and L-shaped) relate to 2nd-4th C occupation.",

Most features had an emphasis on the later Roman period (especially 4th C AD), and early Saxon pottery on site suggests continued occupation. No full specialist reports published for this excavation. The Roman features on both of these excavated sites may well relate to an expansion of activity from the settlement at Home farm/Gilder's paddock, 300m to the east (see ID 14011). Within most of the excavation reports these areas of settlement are interpreted as potentially part of a villa estate.

        "Notes": "Cornwall Archaeological Unit and English Heritage carried out a programme of archaeological fieldwork following the discovery by a farmer of an Iron Age sword in a Porth Cressa type cist grave on Bryher, Isles of Scilly. The fieldwork consisted of topographical and geophysical surveys, evaluation trenching, and excavation and reinstatement of the cist grave. Within the north\u0013south orientated cist were the fragmentary remains of a crouched human skeleton, laid on its right side with its head to the north and facing to the west. In addition to the sword, which survived within a bronze scabbard, the grave goods included a mirror, shield fittings, a sword belt ring, a brooch and a spiral ring (all of copper alloy), together with a shattered tin object. There was also evidence for the grave having contained a sheepskin or fleece and woven textile incorporating goat and other animal hairs. This is the only known Iron Age grave to contain both a sword and mirror, raising interesting questions as to the gender significance of both these grave goods. Analysis of skeletal material showed that the buried individual was about 25 years of age, although preservation of bone and DNA was too poor to determine the person's sex. A long-bone fragment was submitted for radiocarbon dating, giving calibrated date ranges of 200\u001345 cal BC; the metalwork typology narrows this range to the first half of the first century BC. The dates indicate that the Bryher mirror is the earliest known British decorated bronze mirror. The discovery of a second cist (not excavated) a few metres to the south west of the original one suggests the possible existence of a cist cemetery. The cists lie within an ancient terraced fieldsystem that appears to be broadly contemporary. Further evaluation trenching revealed Iron Age \u0013 Romano-British settlement remains at the southern end of the cist field, approx. 40m upslope of the cist, where a stone-walled building situated on top of a terrace contained a stone-lined drain and may have been used as a byre. The building appears to have been around 3.4m in internal diameter. After abandonment the building was infilled with domestic rubbish, including limpet middens and burnt material. Other contemporary settlement remains were uncovered in a field to the east, where limpet middens overlay both sides of a sizeable wall. Stratigraphic and ceramic evidence indicates a break in occupation between the second century AD and the post-Roman period. Limpet middens, visible on the ploughed surface of the cist field and the field to the west, contained ceramics which indicated renewed activity in the area centred on the seventh century AD. The nature of the settlement activity is not well understood, but it has been characterised as a possible farm for the purposes of this database.",

Several of the graves contained grave goods, particularly brooches (see burial data for more information).  In addition to the cist burials an extensive limpet midden containing animal, bird and fish bones was excavated, though the pottery from this feature suggests it was of 9th-10th century AD in date.

Subsequently, at the end of the 1stC AD, a re-organisation of the 1stC AD field-system ensues and D-shaped enclosure becomes the focus for Roman-period occupation.  The settlement comprised of three phases of development and included a formalised trackway on one side. Within the settlement, three stone-footed structures (one an aisled building placed outside the enclosure) were present together with ovens/driers (one a large H-shaped, a possible square drier, plus a stone-lined simple form placed in the aisled building (photos taken)), pits and wells. Molluscan evidence suggests an open, arable landscape in the vicinity. One of the masonry structures included two sheep burials. A short stretch of gravelling may have been part of a nearby road.  Over 100 contemporary burials were excavated from the site and these formed two main groups: an early Roman Durotrigian group and a late Roman inhumation cemetery, probably being laid out by the beginning of the 3rdC AD. The enclosure settlement appears to have gone out of use around the beginning of the 4thC AD, though cemetery and some associated features continued to be used through the 4thC.  A significant post-Roman settlement later becomes established, potentially soon after the use of the site as a cemetery. This settlement consisted of a small complex of post-built timber structures which do not appear to be enclosed. Since the dating of this settlement is insecure, it is not included within the chronology of this settlement.",

The major structure identified comprised a square Romano-Celtic temple dating to the 4th C AD, which overlay two earlier structures of uncertain date. The earliest consisted of a single length of masonry foundation, while above this lay a more substantial two-roomed rectangular plastered building, with a porched entrance facing SE. The RC temple had a probable porch to the SE and had at least one phase of reconstruction, resulting in the aggrandisement of the entrance, the raising of the ambulatory floor, and the construction of 'benches' on either side of the cella entrance. Other structural features comprised a 4th C AD roofed octagonal structure with painted plaster (subsidiary shrine?) and two short lengths of dry-stone walling. The main temenos was metalled.  A ditch ran across the promontory spur marking the limits of the temenos and many metal objects were found in the ditch. Overall, the evidence of coin loss suggests activity from the 1st/2nd C AD, with the main floruit of the site between the late 3rd and mid 4th C AD, after which activity may have lessened. However, the presence of sub-Roman graves indicates that reverence of some kind was maintained throughout the following centuries. The hillfort of Cadbury Congresbury, around 140m to the south, contained a range of Roman material, indicating that there may have been some activity contemporary with the final phase of the temple in the later 4th century AD.",

The only feature of this date comprised an Iron Age pit containing pottery, loomweights and fragments of four adult individuals. There is then a complete absence of activity until the mid 4th C AD, when a Roman farm was established some distance from the earlier occupation. The late Roman settlement  comprised three rectangular masonry buildings (established c AD 335-50), two multi-roomed and interpreted as houses, the other suggested as a byre, attached to one of the houses. One of the houses contained a probable foundation deposit of a large storage jar containing 4 coins placed in a pit with 5 further coins and a sheep skull. An infant burial also lay in the corner of this building, which was later extended and compartmentalised, having 3 rooms with stone-slab floors. The second house building was also sub-divided at a later phase and contained an external stone-lined drain. Three infant burials were sealed by the latest stone slab floor. The non-domestic building is probably dated later 4th AD and had likely animal stalls along with a drain. It contained a partial adult human burial in one of the walls (foundation deposit?). This building was associated with 27 inhumation burials, mostly infants buried after the building was erected. Other features comprised middens and part of a masonry boundary wall, on the same alignment as one of the house buildings and probably part of a walled enclosure. To the south of the non-domestic building lay a cemetery of 25 graves, mostly adult. It is very likely that the farmstead continued well into the 5th C AD. Cropmark evidence suggests these buildings may have been part of a larger complex.",

The remains of many further burials were encountered but not dated and could well be Iron Age (or earlier) in date.",

One of these burials was also cut by a later Saxon grave.  A small Romano-British cemetery of late 4thC AD date, consisting 6 inhumations was also located close to the roadside, clearly set away from where the Saxon burials lay.

It is thought to have been unenclosed. This phase is dated by ceramics to the middle-late Iron Age to the end of the 1st C AD when it appears to have gone out of use. Further activity was identified on site dated by ceramics and coins to the 4th-early 5th C AD. In the north  of the site were a small group of inhumation burials, while further south were probable settlement related features comprising two ovens, postholes, ditches and pits. A strong religious element of the site is attested by the character of the finds assemblage (which includes a curse tablet), much of which comes from an extensive midden deposit (0.115ha), demarcated by N-S aligned ditches. It is likely that the midden was formed over a relatively short space of time, possibly in the very late 4th or early 5th C AD, and may have derived from a shrine in the immediate vicinity (if a structure was present at all?). A nearby pit was partly filled with midden material and seems to have contained a 'special' deposit, of a deliberately crumpled garment collar, bronze spoon and curse tablet, along with large quantities of pottery and animal bone (inc. complete cattle skulls), and some human bone.",

Earlier prehistoric was also noted at the site, but this was not continue into the Roman period activity.  In the northern part of the site, six Roman burials were excavated, four were flexed with grave goods dating to the 1stC AD and were described as 'of native Durotrigian type'. Two other burials were extended, one of which was carbon-dated to c.AD130-270. These are thought to have represented a transitional form containing both 'Durotrigian' and 'Roman' traits.  Adjacent to the burials was a circular structure which was built in the early Roman phase but continued throughout. It comprised of a shallow gully and limestone base and was approximately 6m wide. Two large pits were set within the structure and may have held supporting posts. In the centre a smaller pit contained a 1st C BC cordoned jar from Brittany, which may have been a deliberate deposit. Occupation soils overlying the structure contained waste in the form of animal bones and pottery and it could represent a domestic abode, but it could also have been a shrine considering the ritual nature of the site.  A separate structure to the south of the circular building was identified from four large post-pads which appear to have formed the basis of a large rectangular structure, the function of which is unknown. Two large pits with building rubble were also excavated in this area.  A second group of burials also notable, being excavated in the south of the site and which appear to have been a post-Roman group. It is not known whether these represented a later phase of the Roman cemetery or were a completely new group, but they were carbon-dated between c.AD580-770 and each contained late Roman pottery in the grave fills (c.AD270-400).",

Geophysics and cropmark evidence indicates the presence of wider landscape features, possibly field-systems, associated with the settlement.  Three main phases of activity could be discerned and pottery evidence suggests that this stretched the entire Roman period, possibly into the early post-Roman phase.  The first phase is defined by the formalisation of a ditched EW trackway. This appears to have been cut sometime in the mid-1stC AD. A number of features dating to the 2ndC and 3rdC AD are suggestive of a range of activities likely associated with local settlement, including quarry pits for chalk and possibly flint, a square mortuary enclosure with two associated burials, and a semi-cellared building.  In the late 3rd, or perhaps beginning of the 4thC AD, a long linear boundary cut across much of the 2nd/3rdC area, in particular through the earlier mortuary enclosure, suggesting a reorganisation and discontinuity. However, this boundary respected the trackway which appears to have continued in use running through the centre of the renewed site. On the south-west of the boundary, a planned late Roman cemetery was formally laid out along its northern edge and three building to the south and east of these possibly relate to domestic settlement. The buildings were probably rectangular and were timber post-built. One had evidence for internal division and a central hearth. The structures may have continued into the early post-Roman phase, but the evidence is tentative.",

Occupation of the site then followed continuously until the very end of the 4thC AD or just into the 5thC.  The first phase of activity included the establishment of the cemetery, probably in the 1stC BC, and the construction of a 'cemetery building' and a 'working area comprising two sunken-floored structures, pits and ovens/driers'. The next phase included more burials and further sporadic activity, though no discernible break in occupation was identified. It is suggested that the main habitation area sat half-way up the hillside whilst the upper levels was used for arable and the valley bottom for pasture.  Occupation continued into the 3rdC AD, but here a discernible change in the size and intensity of activity at the settlement. At least nine new buildings were erected, possibly a number of workshops, and the valley bottom which was probably used as pasture prior to this phase became an intensively-used working area. The increased occupation is reflected in a more abundant material culture. The working area had a packed flint and chalk surface and a timber/masonry revetment wall to protect it from hillwash, and included a large H-shaped drying oven. Samples show that this was probably for malting grain. Two inhumations dating this phase were placed next to a field boundary and possibly marked the extent of the settlement.",

The industrial site comprises several Roman pottery kilns, in use until c AD 120, with two kilns in operation until the Antonine period. Iron working was also carried out at the site. The cemetery, situated to the east of the industrial complex, included a line of five mausolea and a cremation burial in a jug, a walled cemetery area, and a number of cremations and inhumations lying between the mausolea and the walled cemetery. The building of the mausolea began in the late-first or early-second century, at around the time of the beginning of the pottery industry at the site. The Roman road was also exposed, and no features pre-dating the road were recovered. It is thought likely, however, that the road predated or was contemporary with the establishment of the industrial settlement, and constructed shortly after the establishment of the fort at Little Chester, in the 80s AD. No buildings of stone survived, but their presence was inferred from scatters of unworked stones found from all over the site. There was evidence for timber buildings and fragments of tile were found scattered over the site and included tegulae and imbrices, indicating that some of the buildings in the settlement were roofed with tile. No certain domestic features were recovered, unless some of the hearths were domestic ovens rather than industrial structures, although the presence of quern stones, large quantities of animal bones and an infant burial were all seen as potential evidence for domestic occupation. The author suggests that most, if not all, hearths were metalworking hearths or furnaces. Iron slag was recovered from all over the site, probably associated with smithing. Although dating for specific activities is limited, it is suggested that metalworking developed as the principal industrial activity after the production of pottery ceased in the mid-second century, though slag in some earlier features hints at some activity before then. Smithing apparently continued into the fourth century.",

The ditched system may relate to two Late Iron Age and Roman settlements in the Grove Farm area (see database numbers 23010 and 23011).The ditch has been interpreted as part of a settlement boundary, supported in the author's view by the presence of the six burials and their relationship to the western ditch.

The cobbles, pottery and charred deposits of grain and antler may represent rubbish but they may also represent structured deposition. The inclusion of sawn and burnt antler in the burial may signify ritual burning as part of the burial. Also, the high proportion of grains with the low ratios of glumes and weed seeds showed that it was a cleaned prime grain product. As there were no signs of burning in the pit it was concluded that the grain had been burnt elsewhere before being deposited in the pit, making it unlikely that this was a storage pit.",

        "Notes": "The presence of a large Roman site at Medbourne has been known since the 17th century. By the end of the 18th century local antiquarian, John Tailby, was recruiting 'illiterate ploughboys and shepherds' to collect finds from the area and during the 19th century there were accounts of hundreds of coins, a 'gallon' of Roman pottery and several brooches implying that this had been a large and intense area of Roman activity. In the 1980s a major fieldwalking survey on the town and four adjacent parishes co-ordinated by the Leicestershire Museums Service. In the late 1980s and early 1990s a series of test-pits were excavated across the hilltop to attempt to locate the edges of the scatter and to begin to characterise activity within the settlement. This was followed by a geophysical survey in 2004 by students of the School of Archaeology & Ancient History of the University of Leicester producing encouraging results from a test magnetometry survey. From these investigations Medbourne appears to be a relatively large example of a Roman roadside settlement (possibly 30-60 ha in total), on the line of 'Gartree Road' a major Roman road running south-east from Leicester to Godmanchester and ultimately, Colchester with a relatively major route possibly joining the Gartree Road from the north. The settlement appears to lie almost entirely north of this road with only a narrow strip of settlement fronting the road to the south. The geophysical survey suggests a series of enclosures (these clearly predate the extant ridge and furrow) with the possibility of at least one building and some industrial activity. The line of the road is known either side of the town; however, the enclosures do not appear to parallel its projected route and this raises the suggestion that either its projected alignment or the dating of the enclosures themselves may be wrong. The test-pits produced cobbled surfaces, ditches, pits, postholes, some industrial activity and a single stone building. Pottery finds suggest Iron\u0013Age occupation with a large settlement developing from at least the mid-1st century AD. The settlement appeared to reach its maximum extent in the 2nd \u0013 3rd centuries and shrunk back towards the core during the 4th century although coin finds suggest some activity into the 5th century. There is also evidence of Anglo-Saxon activity within the core of the settlement. Pottery and an antler pottery stamp die were recovered from a wall and an Anglo-Saxon burial, first reported by John Tailby in the early 19th century, were relocated in one of the test-pits. There is some evidence for a field chapel in the form of a small furlong called 'Old Churchyard which appears to be out of phase with the surrounding furlongs, and the 1835 Stanley estate map records an isolated churchyard. It seems at least possible that this may be an early Christian site associated with later phases of the Anglo-Saxon settlement site which would in turn suggest a site of high status (above adapted from Score 2007, 3). Recent excavations as part of the 2005 Time Team's Big Roman Dig confirmed a 1st to mid-2nd century date for development of the site, as well as features dating from the 2nd to 3rd century, many of which were disturbed by later Roman activity. Whilst the earlier work suggested that the town shrunk in the 4th century, the most recent work has produced strong evidence for 3rd-4th century activity. The 2005 excavations revealed a late Roman cemetery which has been suggested as a possible Christian cemetery based upon the orientation of the graves and the position of the skeletons, as well as the lack of grave goods. Later features at the site produced Anglo-Saxon pottery dating from circa AD 450 to 850, supporting the idea of continuous occupation, although this was located to the south of the late Roman cemetery so some settlement shift seems likely and Anglo-Saxon features were on a different orientation to the Roman features. Two skeletons were thought to be Anglo-Saxon in date, perhaps part of a larger Saxon cemetery.",

        "Notes": "A nucleated settlement with an Iron Age origin, with occupation from before 100 BC to the late 4th century or later (there is evidence for early medieval activity also, but only in the form of unstratified finds, although these were seen as evidence for domestic activity). However, although clearly an important IA settlement, there is evidence for abandonment for as much as three decades following the conquest, before activity resumed again during the late first century. Finds of Roman ballista boltheads and spearheads as well as other pieces of Roman military equipment have been interpreted as potential evidence for an attack on the IA settlement and a resultant reduction in activity during this period of hiatus. IA votive objects and RB figurines suggest a shrine or temple, although no structure is known. In the IA the settlement may have been a major sub-tribal or clan centre and there is evidence for individuals higher in a social hierarchy than subsistence farmers (as indicated by fine-quality pottery, metalwork and silver coins). The settlement was characterised by ditched enclosures, an irregular pattern of streets, roundhouses in the IA and rectangular aisled buildings with stone footings in the Roman period. Excavations revealed evidence for agriculture, stock keeping, craft or industrial activities and trade. There was relatively little evidence for very early Roman settlement. A pottery kiln, early-to-mid Flavian in date, is interpreted as unusual and seen as having a possibly military association, perhaps for use at places other than Dragonby.  Site 1, Middle Roman: Site 1 in the middle period produced evidence for several substantial aisled rectangular building within rectangular ditched enclosures. There were also four 'ovens', the precise function of which were uncertain, but they may have been corn dryers or malting kilns, or domestic ovens. Several wells were also identified. Site 1, Late Roman: Site 1 in the 4th century was characterised by fenced enclosures or 'plots', occupying areas previously used for earlier buildings. At Site 2 Excavations produced evidence for well laid out rectangular ditched and fenced enclosures - main period of use 2nd century AD. This followed a hiatus when, after intensive activity in the LIA, there was little activity during the very early Roman period. An aisled building was identified from within one of the enclosures, and was identified as having a modest domestic function. Different parts of the settlement appear to have been occupied at different periods in the Roman period and Site 2 seemingly became derelict or had a change of use in the later 3rd to 4th centuries.",

The presence of daub also indicates a structure of some sort, although it is not clear whether this might be ritual or domestic in function.

        "Notes": "A nucleated roadside settlement, sometimes referred to as a 'small town'. The site is known through several interventions. Evaluation trenching in 1994 revealed evidence for an early Roman site with ditched enclosures, one of which enclosed at least three roundhouses, including one of approx. 14m in diameter, and an area of stone founded buildings of probable late Roman date, thought to be structures fronting Ermine Street. These buildings were associated with hearths, floor surfaces and drains and are thought to be part of an extensive ribbon development. Additional features on the site include a road or track and a likely stone quarry, used to construct the limestone buildings along the Ermine Street frontage. Pottery from the stone building phases indicated a third or fourth century AD date, indicating that the site continued into the late Roman period. Test pitting ahead of laying of a pipeline in 1999 suggested that buildings had in the late Roman period (mid-to-late 4th century) encroached over the west edge of Ermine Street. Cremation burials were found to the west (these are a separate record, number 24075). A 2000 watching brief over Ermine Street suggested that the road predated the Roman features and provided evidence for the road surface, suggesting that the material for metalling was imported. It also suggested that the later road was either narrower than its predecessor or that it migrated slightly towards the west. Limestone rubble also provided additional evidence for RB structures. Further evaluation in 2001, 200m south of the area of previous investigations, produced further evidence for RB stone structures adjacent to Ermine Street and a metalled minor road extending west from it. An unusual polygonal structure, 15-17m in diameter, probably pre-dating the sub-road, was thought not to be of domestic origin and may perhaps be a shrine. It was probably demolished in the 3rd century.  Four RB inhumation burials were also found, as well as a possible charnel pit. Some of these may have been associated with a mortuary enclosure whilst one of the individuals was decapitated.",

Mid-to-late Iron Age activity was represented by a triple ditch system (see also database number 24095) whilst Romano-British buildings (perhaps 2 stone built or stone footed buildings) along with pits associated with industrial activity were found as well as a ring ditch, possibly the remains of a burial mound. The Roman period evidence was all datable to the 3rd century AD, after a period of abandonment during the first two centuries AD.  A subsequent geophysical survey over the evaluation area (as well as an extension north and west) produced magnetometry evidence for a small enclosure (perhaps a stock enclosure) as well as anomalies representing pits and hollows, including one with a magnetic signal suggesting a small industrial or agricultural feature such as a corndrier. Excavation in 1999 produced further evidence for Romano-British occupation including part of a late 3rd century cemetery containing 12 or 13 individuals, domestic buildings including two probable round houses, pits, ditches and 8 corndriers. One of the ditches contained large quantities of animal bone, probably situated away from the main area of settlement. Whilst some of the corndriers and huts are likely to be contemporary, they were not all contemporaneous as one corndrier cuts one of the ring gullies. One of the huts may have been associated with the storage of grain. The Romano-British cemetery may have respected the presence of the Iron Age ditched feature, as it may have formed one of the boundaries of the cemetery. However, the graves were contemporary with the corndriers and huts. Coffin nails recovered from the graves indicates at least some inhumations were in coffins. A more extensive area of Roman occupation is expected to the south of the site.",

The cross-ridge dyke may have served as a significant land boundary and it continued in existence at least into the Roman period, as observed by contemporary pottery entering its lower fills.  In the late Iron Age, the site underwent a substantial change in use and reorganisation, most notably in the form of extensive gravel terracing and revetment walling being constructed across the area. The walling appears to have delineated a path, enclosed areas and drainage gullies. It was uncertain what this complex was used for, though significant quantities of worked and unworked shale from the gravelled area suggests that the settlement may have had an industrial focus. After the habitation and use of the complex, 19 uncoffined inhumations were buried across the area, some in groups and others being more isolated. A hiatus in the use of the site appears to have followed this phase until the post-medieval period.",

        "Notes": "Site of a prehistoric hillfort with evidence for multi-period activity on its eastern hillside beginning in the Neolithic. The site was located west-north-west of Roman Durnovaria. Excavations in the 1960s and 1970s concentrated on the hillside area which revealed substantial evidence for Iron Age to post-Roman settlement and funerary activity.  The Iron Age settlement continued in use with small developments into the late Iron Age and early Roman phases. However, it was sometime in the late Iron Age that the hillfort was remodelled, becoming multivallate with an elaborate eastern entrance. The hillside settlement consisted of at least 6 structures, though not contemporarily. There may have been a short period of settlement abandonment between the late Iron Age and the early Roman period on the hillside, though two or three new structures were soon erected. A cemetery area was present in this period, and an aqueduct for the new Roman town was also constructed at this time which ran along the side of the hillfort, as well as a Roman road running from the town's western gate. See zooarch data for two horse skulls placed in an Iron Age pit, though the exact date of these is uncertain (i.e. middle or late IA?).  The aqueduct continued in use through to the early 4thC AD, whilst a Romano-Celtic temple may have been constructed within the hillfort between the late 2ndC and the 4thC. This structure has not been excavated, but it is known from cropmark evidence. Also during this period, a series of successive enclosures were laid out with two groups of farm buildings being erected within. Groups of inhumations were also associated with these properties.  In the 4thC AD the farms were abandoned and the enclosures became the site of an extensive and planned late Roman inhumation cemetery. This burial ground included a number of stone-built mausolea and must have served Durnovaria's urban population. However, timber buildings at the periphery of the urban cemetery suggests domestic occupation continued in some form, whilst the hillfort may also have been occupied as well, with the possible temple forming a focus.  After the abandonment of the urban cemetery into the 5thC AD, settlement re-emerged with at least 8 rectangular timber structures whilst 2 or 3 of the late Roman mausolea were still standing and were incorporated into the settlement. The whole settlement matched the cemetery in plan and it appears that it continued to be used straight after. Hillfort activity also continued into this period, possibly associated with the temple. This period of settlement activity continued perhaps as late as the 7thC AD.",

Eighteen barrows were noted in the 18th century and 14 were investigated in the 19th century. Some of the barrows contained urned cremations and they were arranged in a row. The number of barrows makes the cemetery the largest Roman barrow cemetery known from Britain. A substantial Roman building was also excavated during the 19th century, within a northern enclosure on the hillfort, and appears to have been a well appointed structure with mosaics and tessellated pavements as well as elaborate bathing arrangements. The building and its location are suggestive of a religious structure. The author of the summary report suggests that an interpretation of the building as a villa may be more appropriate, although if so its location on the hillfort would seem odd.

The site is known principally from aerial photography and metal detector finds, although some trial trenching has taken place. This record is based on the information available from cropmarks, excavation, fieldwalking, chance finds and detector finds. The site produced significant quantities of Iron Age coins and other artefacts, indicating a significant late Iron Age presence and that the site was one of importance. The coins also indicate a break in occupation in the 1st half of the 1st century AD. The large number of late Iron Age coins has been argued to be potential evidence for the presence of an Iron Age ritual site. The wealth of small finds from the site also indicate that the site was one of some significance during the Roman period and a shrine is also suspected at the site during this period. A cemetery associated with the site was revealed during quarrying, whilst the presence of major buildings at the core of the settlement was suggested when large pieces of pottery, tesserae, painted wall plaster, and a stone capital were brought to the surface by ploughing. Enclosures, building foundations and roads are indicated by cropmarks on aerial photographs, and one cropmark showing a multi-sided building is interpreted as a possible temple.",

The excavation revealed a possible funerary enclosure (perhaps enclosing an area of approx. 170sqm internally) of Romano-British date. Two pottery vessels containing cremated human remains were recovered and analysis indicated that they belonged to a single individual, an elderly female, of 2nd century AD date (the first modern excavation of a Roman-period cremation from Cornwall). Pits within and adjacent to the enclosure were found to contain evidence of burning, charcoal and large quantities of charred cereal grains, interpreted as corndriers.

The Roman period evidence related to a possibly unenclosed settlement and funerary activity. Possible settlement features included at least one building and a group of ditches which may relate to series of small enclosures of 2nd to 4th century AD. The building appears to have been outside the enclosures and was probably a post-built structure of rectangular shape measuring 7.8 x 5.6m. It did not produce dateable finds but it was adjacent to a land surface which produced Romano-British pottery.  The building and enclosures were set within a multi-phased rectilinear fieldsystem covering approx. 9ha, of broad late Iron Age to Roman date. The funerary evidence consisted of at least two (probably three) burials, contained by the major axes of the fieldsystem. The burials were located approx. 40-50m east of the building and comprised a stone-lined cist burial and a possible decapitated inhumation, cut into the edge of a field ditch, lying 5m apart. The third burial was represented by a probable grave pit only. Structured deposition is suggested by the report authors for a considerable assemblage of pottery recovered from a ditch, though they concede that the interpretation is tentative. The pottery assemblage from the site spanned the first century BC to the fourth century AD.",

        "Notes": "A site located on a spur above the River Exe, approximately 2.5km SE of Exeter and 3.5km NE of Topsham. Assessment and evaluation was followed by open-area excavation by Exeter Archaeology ahead of residential development, and a subsequent excavation was undertaken by AC Archaeology. The excavations revealed evidence of at least two late pre-Roman Iron Age settlement enclosures, a Roman military works depot of mid-1st century date and Roman civil activity including some evidence for a mid-late Roman cemetery. The site suffered from significant truncation. Some post-alignments and possible four-post structures recorded at the site may belong to the earliest Iron Age phases, although the earliest clearly identifiable features on the site date to the late pre-Roman Iron Age. The principal components were the remains of at least two major enclosures, one superimposed on the other, sited just below the ridgeline at the centre of the site. There is evidence of additional complexity including probable remodelling of both enclosures. A possible round house, with an internal diameter of about 7m, appears to be located centrally inside the earliest enclosure, and this association is supported by ceramic evidence, with similar pottery recovered from the round house gulley and the enclosure ditch suggesting a date of between 50 BC and AD 50 for the complex as a whole. The earlier of the two enclosures has a plan in some ways similar to late Iron Age banjo enclosures known from the Wessex region further to the east and known particularly well in the Hampshire/Berks/Oxfordshire borders area. The entrance to the second and later enclosure, which may have retained the roundhouse as its focus, is slightly displaced in relation to the earlier enclosure entrance and although it retains a position on the same side it is placed about 9m further to the south-west. Extensive re-modelling of the south-west side of the enclosure including evidence for sections of palisade with or without an accompanying ditch suggest different phases of activity and purpose The later and rectangular enclosure ditch appears clearly to have been functioning at the time of the Roman military occupation as, following a period of brief abandonment, it can be shown by excavation to have been deliberately backfilled to ground level during the Roman military period at Exeter (c. AD55-75). Following the infilling of the later Iron Age enclosure ditch a post-trench building of Roman military design was constructed over the top of it - a terminus post quem of A.D. 55 for this event being provided by a potter's stamp. The most likely scenario for this undertaking was the establishment of a 'fort' which almost certainly would have stood astride the Roman road which led from the fort or fortlet at Topsham to the legionary fortress at Exeter.  The recorded remains of timber buildings within the excavated area of the base included a workshop (fabrica) arranged around three sides of a courtyard with an accommodation block or barrack forming one side. The workshop building on the north-west side of the complex was well represented by post-trenches and post pits indicating an aisled building allowing a high roof line with probable clerestory lighting \u0013 this building had been erected directly above the infilled ditch of the Iron Age enclosure. Further timber buildings were located to the north-east, with at least two showing evidence of rebuilding. These buildings were clearly of Roman military origin but at least some of them may have continued in use following their abandonment for army purposes. They are likely to have been fronting onto the Roman road and thus attractive for re-use in the civil period. The presence of open spaces within the fort, the apparent absence of barracks (although these could be situated elsewhere within the defences) and the apparent random nature of the building plan, suggest that the establishment was not a standard auxiliary fort but more likely a supply base or works depot. The size of the works depot is yet to be established, though it is thought to have been large.  The excavation demonstrated that the defences were deliberately slighted. At the same time some of the buildings will have been dismantled although some of those fronting the Topsham/Exeter road could have been retained into the civil period. Wells and cisterns may have been backfilled at the end of the military occupation of the site and there is some evidence to suggest this. One find from an abandoned cistern, a complete smoke blackened antefix, raises the possibility of a high quality building somewhere within the complex. Similar antefixes are known from the military bathhouse of the Roman legionary fortress at Exeter. A Roman wooden writing tablet recovered from a well, with surviving and readable ink letters, may represent the earliest example of writing recorded in the South-West of Britain. A small number of ditches, forming part of a Romano-British fieldsystem, were exposed in the eastern part of the site. No settlement activity was identified, although industrial activity, in the form of four 'ovens' or firing chambers, was located in the centre of the site. In addition, five Romano-British graves were identified. All were inhumations, although no human skeletal material survived due to the acidic nature of the soils. The presence of the graves suggests a small? Roman cemetery of mid-late Roman date perhaps relating to a community either farming the land or engaged in commerce in a location alongside the Roman road. The 2013 AC Archaeology excavation identified further evidence for military occupation in the form of four timber-built Roman military buildings, at least one of multiple rooms. In addition, a late Iron Age ditch and a small number of pits and postholes of late Roman military and Roman civil date were identified.",

In addition to the evidence for early Roman military activity several graves associated with what is thought to be a late Roman inhumation cemetery were discovered. The funerary evidence included 13 pits, all interpreted as graves, though none contained skeletal material. Eight other features were interpreted as incomplete graves. Most were orientated north-west/south-east, parallel to the river cliff, though two were aligned parallel to early military ditches, indicating that these were still visible features. The different orientation of the groups was felt to be indicative of different phases of activity (at least four phases). The sizes of the five fully excavated graves were consistent with adult burials. The multiples fills of some graves suggested some multiple burials. Finds from the cemetery were iron nails and a residual 1st century coin. These included a group of 12 hobnails indicating an individual with a pair of sandals/shoes. Eight groups of nails from the graves were almost certainly associated with coffins. No evidence for the civil settlement itself was found (though see database number 19052 for potential evidence for this), and this part of the site seems to have been utilised for burial only during the late Roman period. No direct dating evidence was found but the lack of cremation burials was thought consistent with a mid-late Roman date.",

The site occupies a limestone promontory which projects into the upper reaches of Plymouth Sound. The site has been heavily disturbed during development since the 19th century, and much of what is known stems from chance finds. Following what may have been continuous occupation between the late Bronze Age and mid-Iron Age, finds of pottery and coins suggest continued use of the site in the late Iron Age and Roman periods.  The finds attest to contact with neighbouring regions including the Armorican peninsula and with the Durotriges and the Dobunni. Burial at the Stamford Hill cemetery area of the site, initially discovered during the later 19th century, was well underway by the mid-1st century AD, and many of the grave goods (including mirrors, bracelets and Cornish cordoned ware vessels) are thought to pre-date the Roman conquest, though only by a decade or two. The quality of some of the grave goods suggests a high status community. No plan of the cemetery survives and the total number of graves was not recorded though the graves were said to be very numerous. Brooches and other artefacts indicate activity into the Roman period. Whilst Cunliffe's excavations revealed little information about the Roman activity, and the focus of the Roman occupation is not located, the summary of the older finds, particularly the coins, indicates activity throughout the Roman period, and coins of the 2nd and early 3rd century were particularly well represented. The Stamford Hill cemetery also continued in use at least to the end of the 1st century AD. Many of the 19th and early 20th century discoveries were destroyed during the bombing of Plymouth during the 2nd World War, when the museum housing them was hit. Evaluation trenching by AC Archaeology in 1995 produced little additional information about the site, though shell-rich late Iron Age-early Roman midden deposits were encountered.",

The site lies just above the head of a slight valley. Views are extensive to the south and south-west and the River Kenn runs in a south-westerly direction approx. 600m to the south. The cemetery was not fully exposed within the pipeline corridor, but 111 graves were identified and 47 of these were excavated. The cemetery was potentially in use from the 5th to the 8th century AD. The graves were aligned east-west and there was good evidence for the use of wooden coffins; grave goods were not present and the survival of human bone was poor. Within the area excavated five square or rectangular ditched burial enclosures were recorded; four contained a single burial and one a multiple burial.  A probable Roman ditch was also present. Five radiocarbon samples were dated, including three of human bone and two of charcoal. Respectively, the bone samples were dated c. AD 420-660; c. AD 410-660 and c. AD 530-780 (all 95% confidence). The charcoal was recovered from a buried soil and dated c. AD 130-560 and c. AD 0-550 (95% confidence). Together, the C14 dates suggest a date range of between AD 530-660 (at 92.2% confidence) for the burials, and a range of AD 130-430 (95.4% confidence) for the buried soils, suggesting that the soil pre-dated the dated graves, and related to a Roman agricultural phase.  Whilst there is no direct corroborative dating evidence, it is thought that the cemetery may have started in the late Roman period, as there is evidence nearby of high-status settlement from the 4th century (based on the pottery recovered).",

There was evidence for occupation throughout the Roman period, but most evidence pointed towards the late 2nd-3rd centuries AD.  The settlement was established in the late 1st/early 2nd century, with creation of a 'ladder' enclosure system in the mid-2nd/early 3rd century. The enclosures contained at least one roundhouse, possible structural slots and a number of cremation burials. Major alterations to the enclosure system occurred in the late 3rd-mid-4th century, together with the burial of around 40 inhumations, most within a planned cemetery to the north of the enclosure system. At this time the trackway went out of use and quarrying took place. The large number of burials, as well as a large number of coins and evidence for commerce in the form of steelyards/weights etc. make the site unusual and significant.

The work produced evidence for a substantial site of principally industrial character, with salt production the most important industry. The site lies on the west bank of the River Weaver. Roman deposits were truncated, though there was evidence for groupings of buildings, waterlogged structural remains, three cremation burials and a road which provided a focal point of activity on the site. Most features lay alongside or close to the road, with structural features typically positioned at an approximate right angle. Suggestion of organisation and planning to the layout of the settlement, with suggestions that the site was arranged into discrete areas of activity. The road is thought to have been constructed in the very late 1st or early 2nd century, when the settlement is likely to have begun. The cremations were thought to be part of a cemetery lying alongside the Roman road into the settlement on the north-west fringe of the settlement and date from the mid-to-late-2nd century and early-to-mid-3rd century (see burial record). Additional features included five rectangular buildings, a well, the road, another trackway, several brine tanks and troughs. The buildings were in a 'utilitarian area' and one of the buildings measured c. 11m x 4.6m. Two buildings were 2nd century or later and bounded by a large enclosure ditch, and one is thought to have been a storehouse. Different methods of construction apparent for these two buildings. Possible change in function for the utilitarian area in the early-3rd century when a possible animal pen was constructed which faced in the opposite direction of the road. The brine tanks and other objects associated with salt production were all within an area defined in the report as an industrial zone. A clay-lined chamber at the end of one of the brine tanks contained an assemblage of finds including intact pottery vessels, metalwork and unusually well-preserved organic material. Other finds-rich contexts in two other brine tanks, which contained animal bones including cattle, sheep/goat, pig, horse, dog, red deer and domestic fowl, including articulated remains and particular parts of the skeleton including cattle heads. The unusual assemblages suggests structured deposition associated with the foundation and decommissioning of the brine tanks. Activity at the site thought to have ceased in around the mid-3rd century, though there was a final phase of brine collection during the late 3rd-4th century, when wicker-lined pits perhaps represent successive episodes of brine collection on a modest scale. The finds assemblage is suggestive of military involvement at the site. A later evaluation was carried out c. 50m to the east of the Kingsley Fields site and finds included a small number of pottery sherds, a coin, roof tile, a nail and industrial waste, indicating continuation of activity to the east. In addition, an Oxford Archaeology North Watching Brief in the same area produced further evidence for the Roman road and a single pit with a small assemblage of Roman pottery. This indicated that the road fell out of use during the 4th century.",

The site is on a gravel terrace overlooking the Severn flood plain. The investigations produced evidence for a late Iron Age enclosure with a ditch that was re-excavated in the early Roman period, probably just after the conquest. Evidence from pottery, coins and brooches suggests that the ditch was filled again rapidly, perhaps during the 50s AD, when the enclosure was abandoned. There was little evidence for activity within the enclosure other than a handful of pits. The exceptional finds assemblage, apparently dumped in the enclosure ditch when it went out of use, comprises native pottery as well as objects associated with the military, and the site in this phase is interpreted as having a trading function, possibly established by natives trading with the army. Brooches and coins deposited in the ditch during this phase represent a possible structured deposit, although they may have been deposited for other reasons.  The enclosure ditch was partially reused in the 2nd century, and pottery suggests renewed activity between c. AD 120 and 160, when the site probably functioned as a small farmstead, abandoned again by the end of the 2nd century. Evidence for ironworking at the site during this phase.   Some time during the mid-3rd to late 4th/early 5th century the area of the enclosure was reused as a cemetery, with two graves (one prone and both with hobnails) partially cut into part of one the enclosure ditches. Further burials continued in the post-Roman period, including a decapitation burial which suggests that for some time Roman burial rites continued.",

A large pit of Romano-British date was stone-capped and may have had a cairn-like appearance. Two Romano-British cremations were contained within greyware urns and were separated by 0.5m, and were 0.6m north of the stone capped pit. These cremations dated from the mid-to-late 2nd century. A third RB cremation was in a pit and situated 14m south-west of the others. This burial dated from the mid 3rd century, dated by a Nene Valley Colour Coated funnel-necked beaker, deliberately placed within the cremation pit. Iron nails may have related to a coffin prior to burning.  The large, elongated stone capped pit was probably associated with ritual and contained animal bones, chiefly horse (at least two individuals), and butchery marks indicate that they were eaten, perhaps as part of ritual activity associated with a specifically ceremonial area. This pit was not closely dated, containing late IA/early Roman pottery and 3rd century forms.  Additional RB pits were also discovered which may have had some ritual significance, containing pottery and disarticulated animal bones.  A Romano-British enclosure ditch was also recorded, perhaps associated with the cremation burials, although its dating and relationship with the cremations is not certain. Part of a human femur was recovered from the ditch.  Anglo-Saxon burials were also found and further undated cremation burials could possibly be of Roman date.",

In the 2nd to 3rd century the focus shifted from the east to the west side of the site, with the metalling of Mareham Lane Roman road and agricultural land use in the form of ditches and pits, probably associated with stock rearing. A beam slot indicates the presence of a timber building at this time. Development at this time also appears to have occurred next to the Old River Slea, with the construction of a cobbled surface, possibly forming a hard standing area next to the river crossing. During the 3rd-4th century  there was a change in use of the west side of the site, when a sub-rectangular earthwork was constructed, apparently initially an enclosure for a late Roman cemetery, although the cemetery extended beyond this boundary, beyond the limits of the development. Although only a small number of burials (five) were positively dated to the Roman period, the cemetery has been described as 'extensive'.  The presence of nails in some of the graves suggest coffin burials.  A 'high status' stone building was also revealed in the area of the cemetery, suggesting either limited occupation before use of the cemetery or after it fell into disuse, perhaps in the 4th century. During the later Roman period further agricultural use of the area was revealed in the form of further field boundary and drainage ditches, pits and post holes, indicating land division and parcelling of land during the later Roman period. Roman pottery retrieved from the southwest corner of the site included imported samian wares, wine and olive oil amphorae, local Lincolnshire wares and wares from Oxfordshire, Much Hadham, Mancetter Hartshill and Doncaster or Dorset. Hammerscale and fuel ash indicate iron smithing at some level, though perhaps near to rather than precisely on the site.",

Here,  evaluation trenching revealed evidence for late Iron Age occupation in the form of pits and linear features (probably boundary ditches) containing domestic refuse, although no structures were identified. The alignment of the features appear to have respected Mareham Lane Roman road (or its Iron Age precursor). The Iron Age pottery from the site includes French imports, attesting to the high status of the site in this period. The Iron Age faunal remains suggest a very strong emphasis on sheep/goat husbandry with foetal remains indicating the breeding of animals on site and aging evidence suggesting utilisation not only for meat, but also retention of older animals to maximise wool and milk production. Charred plant materials recovered from environmental samples include an input of hearth waste with burnt food stuffs and fodder also suggestive of occupation in the immediate vicinity.  There is evidence for a hiatus after the end of the Iron Age, with no evidence for renewed occupation until the mid-2nd century AD. The Roman activity may have been less intensive than during the late Iron Age. The majority of the Roman features probably represent boundary ditches forming part of the extensive pattern of ditched fields and enclosures evident in fieldwork and on air photography to the east and north. Environmental samples also suggest that the site may have been on the periphery of settlement during the Roman period. 4th century Roman pottery was relatively abundant within a 'dark earth' deposit, although no features dated to this period. Late Roman burials were identified and were seen to have been more regularly laid out with a more regular burial practice than other burials known from the area, but may represent part of the same cemetery area (see database numbers 24090 and 24101).

A cattle ABG may have been a 'special' deposit, or merely an animal burial. Internal features of the enclosure included pits and a possible stock enclosure, whilst a late 1st-2nd century pottery kiln was discovered in part of the enclosure ditch.

The line of Watling Street Roman road passes approx. 135m north of the site. The excavation revealed ditches marking the route of Ryknield Street, which ran north-south through the centre of the site, and a small multi-rite cemetery which lay to either side of the road, including four sub-rectangular mortuary enclosures to the east. A series of hearths/ovens were apparently contemporary with the early part of the cemetery and lay on the western boundary of the site. The cemetery as a whole contained predominantly early-middle cremation burials, with a smaller number of later inhumation graves and some later cremations. It is important to note that there is another cemetery, directly associated with Wall, to the west of the town. It is unclear which population this cemetery is likely to have served. It is possibly a second cemetery associated with the town, though it lies further from the early forts and the core of the town than the other cemetery, and sits along a road to the south of that passing through the town itself. It may therefore perhaps have served a rural community (or communities), and has therefore been included on this database. There is a general suggestion of a shift from cremation towards inhumation burial towards the latter part of the 2nd century AD.",

        "Notes": "A site at Harlyn Bay on the north coast of Cornwall, where excavation ahead of building work in 1976 revealed the foundations of a circular stone building lying beneath the levels of a later Iron Age cemetery discovered in 1900, also during building construction. The report for the 1976 excavation also presents a reappraisal of the cemetery. The early 20th century excavations at the site revealed approx. 130 late pre-Roman Iron Age inhumations though records for these are unfortunately poor. A midden, contemporary with the cemetery, was found 50m to the south. The area of excavation for the 20th century investigation is not known but the 1976 work covered an approximate area of 50 sqm. It is unclear whether the circular building discovered in 1976 was domestic or ritual, though a ritual function is suggested in the report as the remains of two crouched individuals (an adult and a child) appeared to have been buried beneath one of the walls of the structure, and were considered as a possible foundation deposit. The building was therefore considered as a possible candidate for a shrine or mortuary structure (the latter considered most likely in the report). However, the date of the building has recently been challenged based on evidence from C14 dating, and it is now thought more likely to have been a Bronze Age structure, possibly a roundhouse, though it is thought possible that it may have still nonetheless had ritual significance for the Iron Age inhabitants of the area. It is  notable that two small graves containing collections of human skulls were found at the site. In one of these four skulls were arranged in a square formation with a fifth placed 'over them'. In the other three skulls lay in a north-south line and all faced west.  Dating for the site is uncertain, though the cemetery is thought to have been in operation by at least the 2nd century BC and brooches and pottery suggest continued activity during the 1st century AD, and perhaps beyond.",

        "Notes": "The site of a roadside settlement lying adjacent to the modern village of Catterick and 2.2km south of the major Roman town of Cataractonium. Excavations by Wilson (2002) revealed property plots, timber and masonry structures on both sides of Roman Dere Street, with substantial evidence for co-axial field-systems behind the plots surviving throughout the period of occupation. Large-scale geophysical survey accompanied with limited trial trenching in 2005 further revealed the extent and form of the settlement (Speed 2006).  Overall, ten distinct phases of occupation were recorded. The initial period of occupation, after construction of the road, dates c.AD80-120, with the construction of sub-rectangular, beam-slot buildings. After AD120 buildings were recorded lining both sides of the mains road, plus the construction of two metalled roads. The period c.AD150-200 (phases 5 and 6) saw the construction of new buildings aligning the road front, some may have been workshops, and was the first period of masonry construction. These were initially masonry-footed, but later as larger mortared masonry superstructures, one of which included a hypocaust. Recutting of field-system ditches in this phase also points to a possible intensification in the arable landscape surrounding the settlement, whilst inhumations were also first discovered dating to this phase. The maintenance of the high-status building continued into the 3rdC AD signalling continued prosperity, but alongside an apparent decrease in occupation intensity. By the 4thC AD settlement evidence had decreased markedly and, although buildings were still in use, the site appears to have been mainly used for burial. The settlement went out of use by AD350, though burials continued to be received into the late 4th/early 5thC AD.  Although development at the site was clearly influenced by the early forts and later urban activity at Cataractonium, the site at Bainesse was certainly a distinct settlement because excavation of Dere Street at Catterick Triangle (Site 425 - same report) lying c.500m to the north of Bainesse Site 46 showed that the field-systems in that area extended right up to the road, with no evidence for domestic settlement. Bainesse is classified here as an 'small town' in its own right due to the evidence for socio-economic differentiation in the form of masonry buildings, and the presence of the metalled streets aligned perpendicular to Dere Street.  A 6thC AD Anglian cemetery post-dated the Roman settlement.",

Mid-late Iron Age occupation activity was characterised by open settlement including the remains of 7 roundhouses, one of which was located within a large enclosure, 4 square barrows, and four-post structures.  This settlement became overlain by the trackway, running for perhaps half a kilometre north-south, and the enclosure settlement(s) probably in the immediate pre-Roman Iron Age. The main settlement enclosure included internal, ditched divisions, whilst further, more simple ditched enclosures lined the trackway to the north of the settlement. The settlement also included evidence for quarrying, inhumation burial, and arable processing (2 corndriers - T-shaped (2ndC AD?) and square-headed (2nd/3rdC AD) - found as well as more four- and six-post structures). It appears that the quarrying was for limestone; burnt limestone in the feature indicates that limestone processing was taking place.  Some remodelling of the enclosures took place in the 2nd/3rdC AD , though activity appears to have been less intensive and the site may have only been used for burial in this phase. Activity appears to have ceased sometime in the 4thC AD.",

        "Notes": "The site of a roadside settlement at Tiddington, east of Stratford on the south bank of the River Avon. The site has been included as an unwalled roadside settlement in the database, although a large 4th century ditch is likely to have been defensive, though there is no evidence for a wall, and Burnham and Wacher (1990) record it as an 'undefended settlement'. Many excavations at Tiddington have taken place since the early 20th century, and this record is a general overview of the settlement based primarily on Burnham and Wacher's descriptions of the early unpublished excavations, the early monograph of 1931, and a major excavation in 1980-1. More recent interventions at the town for which detailed data are available are recorded individually as separate entries on this database. The earliest (unpublished) excavations revealed a large cemetery, a smaller burial area and an apparent industrial area including pottery kilns. Not all of these were published, and so limited data are available. Large scale excavations took place at the town during the 1980s and development-led work has continued since. The character of the site is defined as an extensive settlement with a mixed agricultural and light industrial base typical of many sites in the grey area between small towns and villages (Burnham and Wacher 1990). The site apparently developed alongside a trackway running north-east to south-west along the south bank of the River Avon, close to an early fort. Mid-Iron Age occupation probably took the form of scattered farmsteads, followed much later by 1st century AD roundhouses with associated rubbish pits and drainage/boundary gullies (quantity of roundhouses uncertain, but 2 placed in box to indicate multiple examples). Pottery and coinage suggests an early to mid or late 1st century AD date for this activity. The site saw major expansion in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries and several internal streets and lanes run irregularly to the north and south of a presumed trackway along the river. Alongside the streets there were several ditched enclosures containing domestic and agricultural buildings, rubbish pits, corndriers and wells. The extent of the settlement is thought to be up to c. 22ha. From the 3rd century onwards there were differences in parts of the occupied area, indicating different rates of development in parts of the settlement. In the mid-to-late 4th century a large defensive ditch was dug. Excavated buildings from the site include timber and thatched buildings, and stone built structures are rare but present. At least six individual rectangular buildings are described in the 1981 report, including one badly robbed aisled building. Paddocks are also known from the site. It is unclear whether the settlement continued into the 5th century, but by the 6th century it is thought that the focus of activity had probably moved downstream to Bridgetown and subsequently Stratford itself. Outside the settlement parts of a fieldsystem were excavated, including small paddocks aligned on the back of the settlement and on the roadway. These contained a number of wells, thought to be for watering the animals. The corndriers and the paddocks are suggestive of a mixed economy for the settlement.",

Radiocarbon dating suggests that the cemetery was contemporary with another cemetery located approx. 400m to the SE (database record 32014), and overlapped with the earlier phases of the Anglo-Saxon burial site.

        "Notes": "Excavation took place at Wasperton, on the east bank of the River Avon, where an area of cropmarks was targeted for investigation ahead of aggregate extraction. The site includes a Romano-British settlement as well as earlier, prehistoric settlement \u0013 (LBA to EIA) \u0013 which possibly continued without a break in the general area to the Saxon period. The site also yielded an important cemetery of 241 individuals dating from the 4th-7th century AD. The Romano-British settlement seems to have been made up of several rectilinear enclosures, whilst parts of a fieldsystem were also excavated, and ditches produced Roman pottery. The chronological development of the Romano-British farmstead is not completely clear, but the settlement is thought to have begun in the 2nd century and, and is thought initially to have been pastoral. Features from the settlement included many ditches and 10 domestic ovens. In the 4th century two T-shaped corndriers were situated within a series of oval and sub-rectangular enclosures, in an area apparently set aside for crop processing, indicating a shift towards the intensive processing of grain, likely to be linked with the large numbers of ovens, thought to be for baking. A timber rectangular building may have been associated, possibly as a granary. Very little other structural evidence was found, other than postholes. An isolated corndrier was also found to the north of the main settlement area (incorporating a reused altar base). Three wells were found (a small number of small finds and a large quantity of animal bone recovered from one of the wells). A possible ritual area was identified in the RB settlement, where two sets of deer antlers with parts of the skull still attached were set to form a square, with an area of burning below them, and underlying this a square slab of sandstone with the inscription FELICITER ('by chance' or 'luckily'). Enclosures interpreted as stock enclosures were also present. The cemetery was initiated in the 4th century within one of the disused agricultural/stock enclosures, lying immediately east of the corndrier enclosure. It was apparently initially in existence at the same time as the corndriers. Inhumations, cremations and decapitation burials were present, whilst grave goods included neck rings, bracelets and hobnailed boots. The inhumations were orientated W-E and N-S, and were interpreted as family plots. The site was interpreted as the cemetery of a quasi-industrial work-force of mixed origins and beliefs in the late Roman period. In the 5th century, until about AD 480, the cemetery continued in use, dominated by post-Roman Britons practising W-E burial without grave goods. An important family buried its dead in a large plot in the SE corner of the enclosure and continued to follow mortuary traditions there into the 6th century. Anglo-Saxon cremations join the cemetery in the later 4th or early 5th century, whilst the main group of Anglo-Saxon cremations arrived from around AD 480. These were followed by further Anglo-Saxon burials which were subsequently inhumations. Two SFBs recorded, one associated with the Anglo-Saxon part of the cemetery. A further two Romano-British burials were recorded from outside the cemetery area, in the area of the Romano-British 'baking area'. No Anglo-Saxon settlement was found.",

        "Notes": "A site south west of Stretton-on-Fosse, approximately 1.1km west of the Fosse Way Roman road. The site was revealed during a watching brief during the 1970s, during gravel extraction, and features included numerous large ditches and pits, several structures and eight inhumations. The ditches were thought to be boundary or enclosure ditches, though they continued well outside the area investigated. One at least, at the west of the site, appears to have been for a palisade, whilst another, to the east, appears to have enclosed many, but not all, of the structural features. Many of the structures were of uncertain character and function, represented by postholes and rectilinear ditches. One possible circular building and three rectangular structures were contained within the principal enclosure, and the rectangular structures contained hearths. At least one had rubble foundations and was a substantial building, whilst another stone-built building was also apparent, and another had at least two rooms. A further possible circular building was located at the east end of the large main enclosure. A further square, stone-built, building was located to the SE of the main enclosure, which produced much pottery and evidence for metalworking and iron slag. This suggested as a possible workshop. Outside the western palisaded enclosure, apparently respecting the ditch, there were six inhumations, whilst a further two were located at the far east of the site (and another isolated inhumation was recorded from a site 100m to the north). The chronology of the site is not well understood, but broad dates suggest that some activity was as early as Neolithic, and one of the circular buildings was Iron Age (though it is not clear what part of the Iron Age, or whether there was direct continuity). However, the palisade enclosure was thought to be first or second century in date, and the site was intensively occupied from the second century, seemingly into the third or fourth century. The burials were undated, but their relative positioning was thought to reflect a Roman date. Part of the west group may represent a scattered cemetery. Classification of the site based on its morphological characteristics is difficult as the plan is clearly incomplete, but in summary there appears to have been a large principal enclosure containing buildings, as well as seemingly external buildings, a separate palisaded enclosure and a cemetery, of multiple phases.",

Evidence included enclosures, postholes and hearths which indicated the position of timber houses of late Iron Age, early-mid/late 1st century, date, one associated with an Iron Age coin. In the late 1st/2nd century roads with drainage gullies were laid out and were accompanied by new roughly rectilinear buildings in timber (no count of buildings, so two included in box to indicate multiples). One 2nd century building contained a bread oven and a corndrier. Buildings were accompanied by wells and clay-lined pits. Two small pottery kilns of late 1st-early 2nd century date were found. The first, probably late 1st century, produced vessels in buff sandy fabrics and a coarser brown sandy fabrics, and these were mostly jars but also included a tanker and beaker. The second, probably first half of the second century, appears to have produced jars in sandy oxidised and reduced versions. The latest building on the site was constructed in the early 3rd century AD, and was timber. It contained a stone-built oven and was probably domestic, though appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century. During the 4th century around 12 burials were deposited across this area of the site, singly and in small groups. The level of material culture recovered from this part of the site was lower than that in other parts of the settlement (see other site records).",

The Iron Age activity comprised a series of scoops containing daub, fired clay and briquetage, interpreted as evaporation pits for salt extraction. Post-holes indicated some structures, removed by later Roman activity. Salt production may have continued at the site until the establishment of the Neronian fort. A probable late Roman burial may have been part of an extramural cemetery, as another skeleton had been found previously.",

        "Notes": "Work by developers in the Town of Hayton, close to the Roman road and opposite the previously excavated Roman fort, revealed the presence of a northern area of the nucleated settlement at Hayton, and includes various phases relating to different stages of development.  The first phase of activity comprised occupation evidence and two graves. A large ditch bisected the settlement, which was effectively unenclosed, with a roundhouse and a series of pits to the south and two roundhouses (or one roundhouse with an annex) to the north of this boundary. This phase dated from the LIA to the early 2ndC AD and the evidence suggests that it took the form of a farmstead before the construction of the Roman road.  It appears that, relatively soon after the construction of the road, the settlement was reorganised with property plot realigned towards the highway. The excavated revealed the rear-ends of some properties, which were divided from the area behind by a major ditch. This area consisted of a probable rectangular building, a kiln, and two cremations. A new enclosure was also established to the south-east, at the edge of the excavated area, which was also intensively occupied by settlement features, whilst there was little evidence of activity in the area between the two occupation sites, though a roundhouse did stand in area. Two L-shaped features likely represent further buildings in the enclosure. This phase dated between the 2ndC AD and the 4thC AD.  By the early-mid-4thC AD the domestic settlements had been abandoned and the site was exclusively used as an inhumation cemetery. The burials can be divided into a two spatial groups: a row of eight burials that lies just outside and overlaps with the Period 2 enclosure and another which lies within the area occupied by the previous roadside settlement. Both groups of burials respect earlier topographic boundaries and, without more refined dating, it seems likely that some overlapped with Period 2 occupation. However, it is also notable that the iron fittings from one of the burials indicate a mid-late Anglo-Saxon date. This raises the possibility that the cemetery continued in use well into the post-Roman period.",

Excavations in advance of housing development revealed late Iron Age activity with the construction of a round barrow and a square barrow with an attached mortuary enclosure in the 1stC BC. Some linear features may also have been late Iron Age in date with the ritual features being set within a new system of land division.  The 'Roman' farmstead may have had its origins immediately prior to the Conquest period with some evidence for pits and posthole suggestive of domestic occupation, perhaps an unenclosed settlement. This quickly developed, however, with the settlement being intensively occupied in the 1st and 2ndC AD. During this phase, the site included 3 corndriers, a system of rectilinear paddocks, a system of gate/droveways and watering complex/trough (presumably for the movement of livestock - see plan 35059_4), and a number of rudimentary structures (though no definite structure plans were identified, parts of curvilinear gullies and arcs of postholes suggest the presence of roundhouses). Two of the corndriers, a T-shaped and a square-shaped, had been abandoned by the end of the 2ndC AD, and were set within superstructures (one with a sunken-feature building). The T-shaped corndrier gave a mid-late 1stC AD archaeomagnetic date from its second firing deposit.  Some later developments were noted at the site from the end of the 2nd/beginning of the 3rdC AD, including the early silting of some of the boundary ditches, the introduction of metalworking activity, and a small group of cremation burials. Occupation ends by the middle of the 3rdC AD, an occurrence which appears to fit with similar changes in the region during this period when other sites with late Iron Age origins were either significantly re-developed or abandoned. A few early and middle Anglo-Saxon features were identified.",

Development in the King Street/Penny Street area over several years has led to the discovery of part of a cemetery, probably part of an arc of funerary activity extending around the southern side of the vicus associated with the fort (see also 42014 for a nearby, probably associated site which produced a tombstone and see 42032 for an overview of the vicus more generally). Excavations at 77-79 Penny Street identified a disturbed horizon of Romano-British date and a small number of features, all disturbed. A small quantity of burnt bone together with sherds of pottery in some of the features indicated that the site had formerly been part of a cemetery containing low status burials, including a discrete possible family plot, which was reused repeatedly from possibly the second through to the fourth century AD. Excavations at 81 Penny Street revealed what may have been a cremation burial, though this was not positively identified as such in the report. An excavation (approx. 444 m2) at King Street, approx. 250m to the SW of the Penny Street sites produced several cremations, dating approximately to the 2nd/3rd century AD. Five of these were cut into the top of a large sub-rectangular enclosure \u0013 probably originally a mortuary structure which was later used as a focus for cremations once the ditch had filled, possibly during the 2nd century. Several rectangular features, possibly inhumation graves of Roman date, cut through the cremations, though no certain evidence for inhumations. An earlier evaluation in the same area produced a further cremation of probable Roman date. In 1987 fragments of a cremation were also found during the digging of a foundation trench at Penny Street.",

A cluster of postholes in this area may be a workshop. It all indicates that there were a number of discrete zones for different activities within the settlement. Minimal activity during later 2nd-3rd C, then considerable evidence for late Roman activity in the form of ovens, enclosure ditches, pits, two unbonded lengths of limestone walling, and two spreads of building demolition material.  At Gilder's Paddock further east was a substantial Roman ditch, south of which lay seven inhumation burials.  A later excavation south of Church Road (0.48ha) 100m to the south revealed enclosure/field ditches, gullies, pits and quarries, probably relating to the southern fringes of the same settlement. Although some evidence for activity in the middle-late Iron Age, the Roman activity here is dated mid 2nd-4th C AD.  Other excavations 2-300m to the west at Cleeve Hall and Stoke Road revealed further late Roman elements that may have been part of the same settlement (see ID 14087). If this is so, then occupation appears to be spread over c 8ha at its height in the late Roman period, and it is thus interpreted here as a nucleated village type settlement, that perhaps grew from a smaller farmstead.",

The site lies on a spur of free draining chalk land, which drops steeply to the flood plain of the River Itchen to the south.  The site was first discovered in the 1984s by workmen laying a gas pipeline. A sword was found which was later identified to have come from a grave. This feature was then entirely excavated and found to also contain other grave goods datable to the mid/late 5th century AD, including an iron socketed spearhead, iron knife, bronze chape and two bronze belt fittings. A further nineteen graves were identified along the gas main trench, but were not investigated.  Two graves were later investigated in 1986: one containing a burial accompanied by grave goods of typically Late Roman date, including a coin and hobnails.  In 1991, evaluations over a much larger area, in advance of development proposals, revealed over 60 graves and a small number of cremation burials; none were excavated. The graves were arranged in rows and at least one was contained within a circular enclosure. The cremations were also identified as lying within small enclosures.  Four evaluation trenches excavated in 2010 over the site of the barrow revealed three north-south aligned inhumation graves, one containing a cremation vessel, and all almost certainly of Romano-British date, were found on the monument's western side.  The various evaluations have shown that the cemetery extended quite extensively to the north of the barrow, though burial features were lacking to its other three sides. In total the cemetery appears to cover an area c.0.4ha. Dating of many of the graves is insufficient, but the cemetery is thought to represent a clear continuation of funerary practice from the 4thC through the 5thC AD .",

The cemetery included between 20 and 30 individual cremation burials and cenotaph deposits. Possible subdivisions within the cemetery and an area of burning, possibly a pyre location, were identified. Evidence relating to the funerary practices associated with the cremations was recovered, the material culture incorporated in the burials, included complete cremation urns, pottery including amphorae and mortaria, oil lamps, glass vessels and nails. Some of the material culture showed evidence of heating and burning indicating its incorporation in the pyre. Also recovered were the remains of votive offerings and ritual feasting, including exotic imports, evidence for which came from material recovered from bulk samples taken during excavation. A small number of inhumation burials with associated material indicated continued use of the area in the later Roman period, during the 3rdC AD. A later gully cut through cremation and inhumation burials indicating the use of the site as a cemetery had perhaps been abandoned by the end of the 3rdC AD or into the 4thC AD.",

All the rectangular buildings (where known) were of beam slot and posthole construction and would appear to be later Roman. One had a complete small cattle burial within. Most structures were surrounded by ditched enclosures. A series of burials were found throughout the settlement and there appears to have been a specialised metalworking area within one enclosure.

The fort and vicus themselves have until recently seen little work and the vicus is known primarily through aerial photography, though see database record 41047 for a summary of recent work in the vicus. There were indications in the material culture, from the epigraphic evidence and from some elements of the grave ritual that the people being buried had come from the Danubian area, and it can be suggested that this cemetery was used by a particular army unit and their families who had been transferred from that area. Besides the burials themselves, features included two funerary monuments. One was probably a square monumental tower, whilst another was probably originally a circular foundation. In addition to the cremation burials there were 12 'special pot deposits', which appear to be deliberate deposits without burials.

The date of the cremations within the cemetery was believed to be principally late 2nd to 3rd century AD, with some continuation into the 4th.

The excavations determined that, south of the fort, the core area of the extramural settlement was focused on the road leading south to the fort at Low Borrowbridge, near Tebay. Three main occupation phases were recorded, commencing in the late second-early third century AD, and either continuing, without interruption, into the second half of the fourth century, or recommencing in the late fourth century after a period of abandonment or reduced activity. The remains of several rectilinear timber-framed buildings (some with evidence for cobble and stone foundations) were found in association with minor roads, lanes, and cobbled surfaces. Activity seemingly became less intensive to the north-east, away from the main street frontage; immediately to the south-west was a probably broadly contemporary fieldsystem, represented by a system of ditches. A second major Roman road was recorded north-east of the main settlement area. This lay beneath modern Moor Lane, seemingly sharing its north-west to south-east alignment, and would appear to have passed east of the fort on an alignment broadly parallel to the fort's eastern defences. Pottery from the excavated surface suggested a late third-fourth-century date, though there were indications that the road may have originated before this. North-east of the road, another system of ditched field boundaries, associated with possible trackways, pits, and several large wells or waterholes, was recorded. Further east still, possible cremation burials and spreads of possible charcoal-rich pyre debris were recorded. Since these remains were located immediately south of the third-century cremation cemetery found in the 1960s, it seems likely they formed part of the same burial ground.",

Between AD 70-75 a road was established in the area investigated, part of the main road leading south from the fort. Approx. 25-40 years later a roadside cemetery was laid out, apparently defined by ditches. This included the important discovery of a tombstone of a Treveran cavalryman, placed on a turf mound.  The cemetery was developed further during the mid-late 2nd century, with internal divisions or plots within the cemetery. The ditches for these divisions and subsequent cemetery ditches were deliberately filled with red clay which may have had ritual connotations. Further potential ritual acts may have taken place at the junction of two ditches though the deposition of organic objects. A possible period of stagnation/neglect during the early/mid 2nd century was followed by reestablishment of the cemetery boundary during the later 2nd century. Further development of the cemetery area by the early 3rd century as ditches were redefined and the tombstone appears to have been moved from its original location and placed in a pit,  and possibly was now housed in a wooden superstructure. The transferral of the tombstone to its new setting involved further ritual acts, with sherds from the same pottery vessel deposited within a pit and ditch. This part of the cemetery appears to be the continuation of a cemetery previously discovered on sites to the north of the area. Truncation meant that the end date of the cemetery is somewhat uncertain.",

Further information on the cemetery is provided by Todd 1975 and EMAB 10, 9. The majority of burials had an E-W alignment, and were of the late third and fourth centuries. Most had heads towards the west. There was a big variation in graves, from rectangular pits to stone sarcophagi. Grave goods were very infrequent. Most bodies were on their backs with arms crossed at the waist. 11 bodies were in stone coffins. 1 double burial (women and infant). Of the coins found (not reported) the latest were 360s issues. The late date and allignment was interpreted as a christain burial. An Anglo-saxon cemetery to the south of the town contained urns dated to the late fourth and early fifth centuries. Some graves within the cemetery were cut through features containing 3rd-4th century pottery. One burial, excav'd in 1963, contained a Belgic tradition grey-ware cup, a cu-alloy stud, and a piece of leather, and was dated to the 2nd-3rd century AD based on these finds.Structures were also recorded during the cemetery excavation. 2 stone walls, one N-S, one E-W, and a small hearth with late roman pottery.

Earliest features in the northernmost area comprised a ditch and elements of a beam slot building, dating to the later 1st C AD. A major phase of redevelopment at the start of the 2nd C AD saw the remains of two timbers structures (long rectangular strip buildings) laid at at right angles to the Botchergate road. These were replaced within the 2nd C AD by two new rectangular buildings (one 4.5x7m) with walls built of earth-fast sill beams. One building contained a large oven and two hearths associated with much metalworking slag (a smithy?). The other building had internal hearths and was probably domestic. In the later 2nd/early 3rd C this building demolished and overlain by surfaces whilst the 'workshop' was re-modelled and extended. Much of the site appears to have been abandoned during the 3rd C AD (extensive soil build up), with reoccupation in later 3rd C, with two clay and cobble wall foundations. Uncertain use and chronology.In a nearby trench a large 2nd C AD ditch was encountered, with random pits, postholes and stakeholes and a well cutting through the silted ditch. In the 3rd C AD an inhumation burial dug.Another main excavation area lay to the south. Earliest activity comprised late 1st C AD timber building, succeeded by activity associated with laying out of the road at the start of the 2nd C AD. Unlike further north activity was not intensive in this zone, with boundary ditches, pits and at least two cremation deposits. A 2nd century ditched enclosure was suggested as a temporary military camp on the edge of the settlement, though it could be part of the expanding civilian settlement. By the mid 2nd C AD this area was part of a planned layout of roads, fencelines and timber buildings. Four buildings revealed (beam slot and post-in-trench construction). Buildings modified and new new ones added (at least one multi-room). The whole area became a cemetery at some point during the early 3rd C AD.",

Pottery from the site in general ranged from the late 1st to early 4th centuries, with an emphasis on the late 1st/early 2nd century and particularly the 2nd century. Excavations to the north had earlier produced fairly strong evidence for a site of military character, probably a fort, and Flavian-Trajanic cremation burials were also recovered during this work. No direct evidence for military activity was found during the course of the CPAT excavations, and whilst uncertain, it is speculated that the evidence perhaps suggests a civil settlement associated with a fort located further to the north, with occupation possibly developing around the trackway. A small inhumation cemetery was undated, but thought to be of early medieval date, with the alignment of graves suggesting a Christian origin. Six of the graves were cut through the Romano-British trackway.",

Very little excavation has been carried out, and many of the buildings associated with the possible vicus settlement is interpreted from aerial photography. Arnold and Davies (2000, 22) suggest the presence of a bathhouse and a mansio outside the south-east gate. However, the site is notable for two associated barrow cemeteries lining two of the roads leading from its north-east and south-east gates respectively. These have always been considered to be Roman, due to the fact that they lie astride the roads, though the exact dating of the barrows are not fully ascertained. They have not been excavated but have variously suffered from metal-detectorists and early 'antiquarian' explorations. The south-east group lies c.600m in the same direction from the fort and consists of seven barrows. One of these is an exceptionally large (c.11.5m) example is enclosed by a square bank and ditch. The north-east group consists of two sub-groups of barrows located c.500m in the same direction on a prominent ridge. The first sub-group includes 7 barrows lying close together but quite randomly placed, and the second includes four barrows in a linear formation. Crew et al. (1989) note that disturbance by metal-detectorists produced a sherd of a Roman coarseware flagon. The dating given here is that used for the Roman fort and not necessarily that of the barrow cemeteries.",
